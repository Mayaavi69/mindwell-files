World's Quickest Personality Test
welcome to the world's quickest personality test what i'd like you to do is hold out your hands in front of you make certain they're level and then close your eyes so don't just sit there actually do it hands out and now close your eyes don't lose my voice in the darkness now imagine there's a helium balloon attached to the fingers of your right hand so it's gently pulling your right hand up into the air at the same time imagine a pile of books on your left hand the books are pushing down on your left hand and pushing it towards the floor the balloon is pulling the right hand up the books pushing the left hand down now enjoy any images that float into your mind but still remember that your hands are being pushed and pulled excellent now open up your eyes so what does it mean well if your hands are far apart then you tend to have a good imagination you're sensitive intuitive and you easily become absorbed in books and films if your hands are level you're more down to earth you're more logical you're more analytical and you enjoy puzzles and games and if you saw an image of a puppy well you just tend to be a little bit suspicious
