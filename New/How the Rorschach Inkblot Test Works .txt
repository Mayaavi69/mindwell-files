How the Rorschach Inkblot Test Works 
The Rorschach inkblot test is a type of projective assessment in which subjects look at 10 ambiguous inkblot images and describe what they see in each one. The therapist then interprets the person's answers.
This projective test often appears in popular culture and is frequently portrayed as a way of revealing a person’s unconscious thoughts, motives, or desires. Learn more about how the Rorschach inkblot test was developed, as well as how it is administered and scored.
History of the Rorschach Inkblot Test
One of Hermann Rorschach's favorite games as a child was Klecksography, which involves creating inkblots and making up stories or poems about them.1
Teles RV. Hermann Rorschach: From klecksography to psychiatry. Dement Neuropsychol. 2020;14(1):80-82. doi:10.1590/1980-57642020dn14-010013
 He enjoyed the game so much that his school friends nicknamed him "Klecks," the German word for "inkblot."
His interest in inkblots continued into adulthood. While working in a psychiatric hospital, Rorschach noticed that patients with schizophrenia responded to the blots differently from patients with other diagnoses. He began wondering if inkblots could be used to create profiles for different mental disorders.
So, inspired perhaps by both his favorite childhood game and his studies of Sigmund Freud's dream symbolism, Rorschach developed a systematic approach to using inkblots as an assessment tool.

Uses of the Rorschach Inkblot Test
The Rorschach test is used in psychotherapy and counseling, although not as frequently as in the past.3

 Practitioners use it to gain qualitative information about their patients, helping them learn more about the patients' personalities, emotional functioning, and thought patterns.
The results of the inkblot test serve as a springboard to further discussion about issues patients purportedly illustrate. For instance, the Rorschach has been shown to help assess the personality structure of patients with schizophrenia.4
Likewise, organizations sometimes use this test to measure people's attributes such as creativity, intelligence, and temperament. Its results can help them decide the person's suitability for employment, whether to allow acceptance into an organization, or if adoption approval is appropriate.
Administration of the Rorschach Inkblot Test
There are 10 official inkblots in the Rorschach test, each printed on separate white cards. Five inkblots are black and gray; two are black, gray, and red; and three are multicolored without any black. 
During administration, the examiner will sit next to you. This helps them see what you see. The test involves certain steps:
1. Present: The examiner will give you one card at a time and ask you, “What might this be?”
2. Respond: You’re free to interpret the ambiguous image however you want. You can take however long you like to interpret each card and can give as many responses as you want. You can also hold the cards in any position, such as upside down or sideways.
3. Record: Your examiner records everything you say, no matter how trivial. They’ll note the time taken for each response, the position the card is being held, your emotional expressions, and other metrics during the test.
4. Confirm: After you go through all the inkblots once, the examiner will take you through them a second time. The goal of this is not to get new information but to help the examiner see what you see. They’ll ask you to identify where you see what you originally saw and what features make it look like that.
Scoring the Rorschach Inkblot Test
So what exactly do interpreters of the Rorschach test look for when analyzing responses to the inkblots? The actual content of the responses is one thing, but other factors are essential as well.
Content
Content refers to the name or class of objects used in your responses. Some common contents include:
* Whole Human (H): A whole human figure
* Human Detail (Hd): An incomplete human form (e.g., a leg) or a whole form without a body part (e.g., a person without a head)
* Human Detail (fictional or mythological; Hd): An incomplete fictional or mythological human figure (e.g., wings of an angel)
* Animal Detail (Ad): An incomplete animal form (e.g., cat’s head, claw of a crab)
* Sex (Sx): Anything involving sex organs, activity of a sexual nature, or sexual reproduction (e.g., sexual intercourse, breasts)
* Nature (Na): Anything astronomical or weather-related (e.g., sun, planets, water, rainbow)
Location
Identifying the location of your response is another element scored in the Rorschach system. Location refers to how much of the inkblot you used to answer the question. 
* D: if a commonly described part of the blot was used
* Dd: if an uncommonly described or unusual detail was used
* S: if the white space in the background was used 
* W: if the whole inkblot was used to answer the question
Determinants
Determinant coding is one of the most complex features of scoring the Rorschach test. This is where the examiner considers the reasons why you see what you see. What inkblot features helped determine your response and how?
There are six broad categories of inkblot determinants you could be responding to:
* Color
* Form
* Movement
* Pairs and Reflections 
* Shading
For example, if you report seeing a flower in Card 8 because of the red color, your examiner may code that response as color determinant. Each category has subcategories and there are at least 26 possible determinant codes. More than one determinant can be used in a single response.
Interpretation of the Rorschach Inkblot Test
Interpreting a Rorschach record is a complex process. It requires a wealth of knowledge concerning personality dynamics in general, as well as considerable experience with the Rorschach method specifically. 
In addition to formal scores, Rorschach interpretation is also based on behaviors expressed during the testing, patterns of scores across responses, unique or consistent themes in the responses, and unique or idiosyncratic perceptions.
