Full Interview: Dr. Jim Fix, clinical psychologist
what is your background as it pertains you know our subject matter sure my background is a pertains to this as I've been a clinical psychologist for over 20 years now thirty years in the field of mental health almost all of my experience has been with crisis intervention whether working in inpatient psychiatric units crisis resident crisis residential programs emergency departments I spent ten years working with law enforcement here in San Diego County as the director of the perk program and now I'm back working in the emergency department in a hospital system the biggest barrier for people getting mental-health treatment is there's actually two types of barriers there's external barriers and there's internal barriers so the external barriers would be access to care finding a doctor going to the treatment having the insurance and those sorts of things the bigger problem are the internal barriers there's the stigma against mental illness but the largest barrier for people getting treatment with serious mental illness is the lack of insight we call it an aside nausea this is a neurological condition that renders the person unable to be aware that they have a mental health disorder so if you're not aware you have a disorder you're not going to seek treatment for it that's the biggest barrier so how difficult is it then for friends and family to even approach this person that's the $64,000 question we need to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental illness and our friends co-workers and loved ones because many times they don't recognize it in themselves so we need to be able to approach them in a particular way that's respectful and trusting that they're going to listen to us and seek out treatment it's a very fine line it's much easier said than done but there are some strategies that we can employ that are going to improve our chances of that person listening to us as a red flags for for mental illness would be any changes in the level of functioning that the person has whether it's in school work interpersonal relationships social isolation and withdrawal from others is another very large warning sign changes in mood somebody who becomes increasingly depressed or despondent changes an appetite and sleep drug and alcohol use and increase in that for somebody who doesn't normally use drugs or alcohol thought-process difficulties somebody who's having a difficult time concentrating and focusing so you'll see changes in behavior at work or functioning at work in school sure yeah about 50% of all mental disorders occur before the age of 14 or 15 so they can happen to very early and younger school-age children middle school high school these are all the times where a lot of these disorders become recognized in people and it's difficult to ascertain what's normal adolescent behavior moodiness poor grades poor school performance so it's really it's really important to keep an eye out on these things and to be communicating with these folks about what's going on and when there are more than one or two red flags to make sure that you get that person in to see a mental health professional for an assessment correct many times people aren't aware they have a problem if you have a phobia of speaking in public obviously when you get up on stage and you're nervous you know you have a problem if you have schizophrenia and you have a delusion that the FBI is out to get you but that's a fixed false belief that you truly believe you're not going to know that that's not real so you're not going to seek treatment for that you're going to be seeking ways to protect yourself or to hide there's kind of a secret about medical professionals actually being able to gauge when someone may become violent how did you put that I think the way I put it was it's sort of our dirty little secret of were not with that great at predicting violence in people in the situation with the Holmes family he was seen by a professional with this family when he was 12 years old they weren't able to predict the violence in the future at that point in time so it's very important that we continually assess and people that have the red flags and we're only as good as the information that we're getting if somebody is not giving us what they're thinking and feeling and all we have to go off is their current and past behaviors that doesn't give us a whole lot to go on sometimes so we need to put all that together and look at all the different red flags all the warning signs and what we're getting at that point in time and I've come to realize that sometimes it's what they're not doing anymore so I think when people are hearing this they're talking about a red flag red flag if we don't talk about what they stopped doing or negative symptoms we may not be telling them everything the whole story as well so just wrap around and kind of right absolutely so when we do an assessment we're looking at the things that are going wrong the things that they're thinking feeling and the behavior but then we're also looking to other things that people aren't doing that they used to do so their school performance their work performance are they're interacting with other people are they getting out of bed are they eating are they performing good hygiene these are all things that can go downhill and somebody has a mental illness sure we we do have barriers and communicating with family members and caretakers right now we have confidentiality laws we've all heard of HIPAA we have California state law that's even more stringent than HIPPA and without the patient's permission unless there are imminent risks of danger towards either themselves or to the public we're not able to break confidentiality to speak with family members or caretakers or loved ones without the patient's expressed written consent so that can make it very difficult for us to communicate with a family the flip side of that is though we are allowed underneath the current laws to communicate with family members and caretakers and other providers when we do believe there is a risk but I think many of us are very very cautious about when to break confidentiality and to call somebody and let them know something's going on and there's a couple reasons for that one are these confidentiality one is the confidentiality laws that were carry very heavy fines and monetary penalties to them and the other is the therapeutic relationship with the patient it's very sacred to have that trust between doctor and patient and if we violate that we violated that relationship and it's that relationship that can be so important to getting somebody into help so we really have to weigh the best that we can that fine line of maintaining confidentiality and weighing that with the the safety of the individual in the public and obviously the person's safety and the safety of the public should should triumph but we need to make sure that it's it's risen to the level that we really do need to violate that there are ways right now there is legislation being proposed by Congressman Tim Murphy the helping families and mental health crisis Act that seeks to sort of lower the threshold on HIPPA and the state confidentiality laws that would make it easier for us to communicate with with family members and loved ones of people who we feel are approaching that imminent risk right now you pretty much need to be an eminent risk and and that's fairly defined by laws you know an immediate risk to self or other people so we're seeking you know congressman Tim Murphy and other people are seeking to lower that threshold a strong therapeutic relationships another way that we can work with our clients and work with them and say it's we think it'd be very helpful right now for your parents to know how you're thinking and feeling so they can support you so it's it's difficult but not impossible time you've told me too you ask patience can I tell your wife what can I talk to your mother whatever and the patient says no so when there are situations that come up where I think it would be very beneficial for the patient and their family member to know what's going on with them I ask their permission I'll say you know this sounds like this is a very important thing that we need to discuss I think would be helpful to have your parents or your spouse or your loved one or your roommate whoever it may be your significant other in on this treatment plan can I speak to them about that can't we speak to them together about it and when they tell me know that I asked them further why don't you want me to talk to them about it and sometimes it's because they're embarrassed they don't want them to know they want to keep keep that significant other protected from how how they're feeling or thinking other times they may want to act on those thoughts that they're having and that's that's something that needs to be explored I don't just stop at the yes or the no I want to explore it and dive deeper and keep getting around to it most of the time I work in an emergency department and inpatient psychiatric settings right now and many times the people that I'm assessing are not wanting me to share information with other people and to me many times that is a red flag if we can't bring in that person's support system to help treat them that we call a lower level of care not admit them to the hospital to get them back home we need to make sure we have a good treatment plan in place a safety plan so that person in the public are safe and if we're not allowed to create that safety plan and that treatment plan then many times that's a that's a warning sign to me that that person isn't safe to go home or isn't safe to leave just yet and may need inpatient treatment sometimes that would include a 72-hour hold sometimes so sometimes when people that I'm assessing in an emergency department and we're trying to create a treatment plan or safety plan to get them back into the community to avoid coming into the hospital if that's not the appropriate thing for them sometimes they won't allow us to contact family members or significant others so the doc that's another red flag for me that we're not able to pull in that person's support system that they desperately need at that point in time so they may need to come in to the hospital for some further evaluation treatment and stabilization sometimes that is against their will on what we call a 72-hour hold or a 5150 is the welfare and institution code number for that here in California many times the person will still sign in on a voluntary status and come into the hospital you've mentioned so at the end of the 72 hours what happens if the person isn't ready to go home yet there are several things that can occur when the person can sign involuntarily at that point in time if they'd like to remain in the hospital if they don't want to stay in the hospital but they still they're still not ready to go home and they still meet the criteria to be held against their will either danger to self danger to others or gravely disabled due to a mental health disorder then we can extend those holds by going through a judicial process of 14 day holds 30 day holds temporary conservatorship conservatorships up to permanent conservatorship which is good for one year so those are different options that we have to take care of people who at the time don't feel they need to help it's been family genetics is important and we certainly know now that heredity plays a role in mental illness but not always we know having a parent or both parents who are mentally ill increases the odds of a child having a mental illness or a sibling having a mental illness there's certainly a lot of work on that right now and that's an important part of our assessment looking at the family history but just because there is or isn't a family history doesn't change what we're dealing with on a one-to-one basis with a patient that's sitting in front of us do you think though there's more families that maybe have like you know Uncle Tom had an issue but nobody talks about it yes absolutely I think just like drugs and alcohol trauma abuse of family histories just another one of those kind of symptoms or risk factors that we look at when we're going down a list in our assessments of I've seen what's going on with the person at that point in time but the education is important you definitely have a higher risk factor if there's a family history of mental illness absolutely we need to be talking about these things we need to be normalizing at one in four san diegoans live with the mental health disorder right now one in two of us will experience a diagnoseable mental health disorder before we pass away in our lifetime 17% of high school students have seriously considered suicide in the last year so it's very common we need to be talking about it we need to get rid of the stigma associated with mental illness and we need to get it treated just like any other medical disorder violence with the mentally ill is very rare mentally ill people who are in treatment are no more violent than the general population people who aren't in treatment there is a small subsection of those people with typically psychotic disorders schizophrenia or bipolar disorder that are prone to violence these are very rare cases but when they happen they have devastating consequences it's imperative that we recognize the warning signs and get people into early treatment to prevent these sorts of things from happening far more common is violence towards oneself in the form of suicide or self-destructive behavior and many many more people live lives that are full of terrible symptoms that affect them just for an example I assess a person the other night who had left his bedroom in five years and the family finally got to the point to where they thought enough is enough called the PERT teams had them go out and brought the person into the hospital after five years there's years of suffering going on in individuals and families far more common than violence for that small percentage suffering from bipolar or schizophrenia that could be violent what needs to change so that those few people don't go from suffering with the mental illness to then untreated spoken about unshared information well they need to come to our attention for one so the warning signs may be recognized by somebody a significant other family friends co-workers teachers coaches churches we need to be aware of it and those folks who need to be encouraged to be brought in for treatment if they are extremely psychotic showing extreme symptoms then they need to be brought into the hospital system whether by law enforcement by our per team's here in San Diego and we need to engage them in treatment when treatment fails our attempts to engage them in treatment fail we now have laws in San Diego County that were just enacted by the Board of Supervisors called assisted outpatient treatment Laura's law so we have just started a county program and is court-ordered assisted outpatient treatment for those few individuals in San Diego County and throughout the state of California every different county needs to enact it we can get people who are dangerous who are repeatedly coming into the hospital or being incarcerated who are dangerous to themselves or to other people we can get them court-ordered into assisted outpatient treatment which has shown great results in getting these people engaged in treatment and for someone affected by this someone for which many people have this rule reaction immediately to the story what I believe that there's nothing more courageous than what Arlene has done by coming out to talk about this as a parent I can't imagine anything worse happening and to be able to face people who have been critical people who are ignorant of mental health disorders people who are fueled by the stigma I can't imagine the courage that it takes and I think that it's very important to get the word out to let people know that the devastating consequences of untreated serious mental illness can affect so many more people other than just the person living with it or the family there's a lot of people absolutely we're bombarded by messages and warnings of all sorts of things every single day our diets are exercising all that mental health awareness and responding early is imperative there are thousands of family members right now in San Diego County who have a loved one who is living with a mental health disorder that's not being treated that unfortunately can either live an unhappy despondent life or worse and can be a perpetrator of violence on US grand scale and we need to get those folks into treatment and there's many many different places that we can get people into to be assessed and treated by mental health professionals I know we're going to have a lot of links on your website for that right many times people will recognize it in somebody else and it might not be their son or daughter maybe it's a neighbor maybe it's a kid in their youth group and think this isn't my problem but this really is everybody's problem and we all have a role to play whether we're close to that person or not and it's as simple as saying to either that person or their parents if they're a youngster hey I'm seeing some some things that are troubling to me can we have a conversation about it and it's it's we need to do that it's imperative so early prevention is key for mental health disorders the earlier we can recognize and intervene typically the better the prognosis and the less the less severe the disorders can be with our early intervention and prevention okay so the leap Institute well how do I want to tell you about the leaf Institute so the leap Institute is founded by dr. Javier Amador who's a clinical psychologist who had a brother living with schizophrenia he's become the leading researcher in lack of awareness or insight in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and he developed a communication strategy called leap which stands for listen empathize agree and partner which is a very which is a very effective communication strategy to use with people who don't believe they have a mental health disorder many times family members will recognize it in a loved one and will get into a power and control struggle with the person saying you're mentally ill you need to go for help and the person who doesn't believe they're ill will become angry defensive withdrawn many times there's anger frustration screaming yelling a lack of relationship between the person who recognizes it in their loved one and the loved one themselves that is very detrimental to getting the person into treatment but it's off it's easy to see why somebody could get to that point you obviously have a problem and you're not going to get help for it so that can increase the tension in the home which actually can actually lead to increased violence so with the leap method we teach people how to strengthen the relationship with that person by using very specific communication strategies a specific kind of listening a specific type of empathy agreeing on things and partnering on them and the one thing that we don't tell them is that they're mentally ill and they have to go to treatment right away we want to build our relationship so at the leap Institute we have a saying it's not the strength of the argument it's the strength of the relationship so the stronger relationship we can build with the person whether it's a therapeutic relationship with a doctor and a patient or a relationship between a parent and a daughter or a son or a husband and a spouse or a friend the more likely we are going to get them to agree to go to treatment down the road so in San Diego County we are very fortunate to have specially trained law enforcement who also have licensed mental health professionals as civilian partners here in San Diego County called the PERT team the psychiatric emergency response team so when people rise to the level that they are in a crisis needing immediate help and they're not willing or able to go get help people in San Diego County can call 9-1-1 and request a per team to respawn you'll have specially trained law enforcement officers and a mental health professional come to the location of the person in distress do a mental health assessment and determine if they need to be taken somewhere for help at that point in time or provide them referrals or take them to a doctor's office or take them back home to their social support system so if you find yourself in a crisis situation and you don't know what to do feel free and have confidence in calling 911 San Diego County so many people who I speak with say I don't want to take medication it's the first thing that pops into their mind when it comes to mental health treatment not everybody needs to take medication not everybody requires medication sometimes they do but many times talk therapy or a combination of talk therapy and medication are the most effective treatment but it takes an assessment with a mental health professional and a discussion with that person to see what would be the right course of treatment for them so it's not always a knee-jerk reaction straight to medication and it's important for people to know that that's not going to happen the first five minutes of an assessment
