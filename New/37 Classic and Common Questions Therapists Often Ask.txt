Classic Therapy Questions Therapists Tend to Ask
37 Classic and Common Questions Therapists Often Ask
What is the problem from your point of view?
Defining a problem in the initial stage of therapy can often be challenging; clients come in with unique perspectives on what the problem is and sometimes with what the solution to that problem should be.
Empathic, nonjudgmental listening is crucial. The goal is to make the client feel acknowledged and accepted for who they are, and for that, caution and patience are required.
The point of counseling is to create positive changes without the client feeling hurried or being worked on.
* How do you see the problem?
* How would you define the biggest challenge you’re facing right now?
* What are the things or people in your life that are causing problems for you?
How does this problem typically make you feel?
Validating clients’ feelings is an integral part of rapport building. Feelings are not facts, and there is no right or wrong way to feel about any given situation. Some clients are less equipped at articulating their feelings and may need help naming them.
When strong negative emotions show up, one way to deal with them is to parse them into smaller, less potent feelings. Practitioners also often observe that their clients are subject to conflicting emotions, and probing into those can often prove to be very useful, although at times uncomfortable for the client.
* How does this problem typically make you feel?
* How do you feel when a problem pops up unexpectedly?
* Do you feel sad, mad, hopeless, stuck, or something else?
* What else do you feel? Tell me more.
* When you tell me you feel angry, what else do you feel? Disappointed, hurt, betrayed,
What makes the problem better?
* How often do you experience the problem?
* How have you been coping with the problem(s) that brought you into therapy? What have you tried so far?
* What do you think caused the situation to worsen?
* How does the problem affect how you feel about yourself?
* What avenues have you pursued in the past that have worked well to solve the problem?
* Tell me about a time when you were not experiencing these difficulties.
* Overall, how would you describe your mood?
* Robert Thayer (1997), who studied how moods influence behavior, suggested that we should see moods as a form of internal barometer and a reflection of the interactions between our psychological states and our physiology, rather than mysterious, purely emotional reactions to events around us.
* Unlike fleeting emotions, moods are more like the weather and represent the underlying biology of our daily cycles of energy and tension.
* When we find ourselves overwhelmed by stress or tiredness, we are more likely to reach for self-destructive habits. Understanding our moods and their fluctuations better can allow us to improve our personal effectiveness substantially, both mentally and physically.
* Describe your typical daily mood. Is your mood like a roller coaster, or is it pretty steady?
* What energizes you and makes you feel more upbeat?
* What brings you down or makes you feel blue?
* How do you typically handle irritations, aggravations, and frustrations? Do you get mad easily? How does your anger come out?
* Do you feel mad when you don’t get your way or lose control?
* How do you get yourself out of a bad mood?
* We all use different strategies to cope. Do you find yourself reaching for caffeine, drugs, alcohol, sex, shopping, the internet, or something else to make you feel better?
* What have people close to you told you about your moods?

How connected do you feel to the people around you?
Exploring the dynamics of clients’ relationships with people in their lives can be a good predictor for how they will respond to forming a relationship in therapy, as we often play out similar tendencies in most of our relationships.
* Tell me about the important relationships in your life.
* What was it like growing up in your family?
* What do people keep doing that you dislike, and what do you wish they would change?
* What wrongs have been done to you that you haven’t forgiven?
What positive changes do you want to make in your life?
Exploring clients’ goals for therapeutic engagement and their attitudes toward change allows the practitioner to glimpse into what our clients value and what frustrates their ability to honor those values in their lives.
* On a scale of 0–10, how content are you with your life?
* Do you regularly set positive goals for your work life, your relationships or health, and relaxation?
* What is your attitude about change?
* What are these goals?
* What keeps happening repeatedly that keeps you from achieving them?
