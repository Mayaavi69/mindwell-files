CBT formulation in anorexia: Case study clinical example

hi jody nice to see you again how have you been since i saw you last yeah i've been fine um been sticking to the plan so it's been going well hold the plan that the hospital set you yeah okay fantastic and how have you been finding that yeah it's been it's been good um i've been trying to follow it but last week wasn't very good i had a bit of a bad day but since then i've been fine so it's okay okay so tell me a bit more about that bad day i mean what did you eat on that day um i don't think i had anything okay so you just ain't nothing at all yeah okay i mean tell me a bit more about why was that day difficult was there anything that had been happening around that time um it's been quite busy at school because we've got our exams and we had like a test the next day so i think i was just a bit like worried about that so i was trying to focus on that instead so you were feeling a bit anxious about the exam that was coming up was there anything else that was worrying you um i think we had um well we had six form applications jimin and that was coming up in the next couple of days and i didn't really want to fill in my application for that so it sounds like there was a couple of things that were worrying you that were on your mind yeah which thing was worrying you more do you think probably the same form yeah the city film one okay what kind of how did you feel about that when when we talk about that now when that's brought up what kind of emotions do you experience um i don't really want to start sixth form yet it's quite soon but i don't really want to i mean i've got exams first so i've got to think about those but i don't really want to go to sit form at the minute okay so what is it about sick form that makes you not want to go i have to start over again and make new friends and and like a new routine and stuff and i don't i don't really feel ready for that yet what do you think might happen when you have to make new friends and start a new routine i don't i don't know if anyone's going to like me like if they might not want to talk to me and then i won't be able to like focus on my work and and get through it so you're worried that you might not be able to make friends yeah you might not be able to focus on the work yeah and how do you feel when you have those thoughts um a bit worried i don't know what people are going to think so i don't want to upset them and say anything wrong or do anything wrong and i suppose i'm just trying to understand kind of because that what you were just describing that's more what i would kind of think of as being a thought you know worrying about what what people might think and that people might think the wrong thing and i suppose i'm wondering how you're feeling you said you feel worried are there any other emotions that you feel about it um i feel it makes me feel a bit sick inside having to talk to new people so you feel a bit worried and a bit sick how easy is it for you to think about those kind of emotions and those feelings that you're describing i don't really think about them and just try and ignore them and get on with what i need to do were you aware that you were feeling worried on the day that you stopped eating you were conscious that you were feeling anxious and worried no i didn't feel worried that day i was just trying to get on with my work and i actually felt a bit better that day okay so why do you think that you turned to stopping eating because i mean now i suppose now that you're aware that you are feeling worried about sick form and about the exam why do you think that you opted to stop eating on that day what was it about that do you think that you thought might be helpful i i didn't feel like i needed to because i i didn't feel hungry so i just wanted to do my work and and then it made me feel better and i felt more i felt more focused on my work so i thought i should carry on with that because i needed to revise so you thought it helped you to focus and you felt like it helped you do you feel like it did help you with the revision yeah i was more focused on on the work i needed to do okay so you felt like it improved your focus as well yeah okay is there any other reasons why you think you might have turned to constricting your diet at that time i think my my father wanted me to like my dad he wanted me to um focus on my work because of my exams so i didn't want to like upset him and i thought i needed to do well in the test so i was trying to do that so you thought that by not eating you would help yourself to do better in the exam and kind of please your dad yeah and do you think that it was helpful constricting your diet it seemed to be i got more work done during the day because i didn't get distracted by anything so i could i was revising all day and then the test went really well so it should be good you should get a good mark for it you seem like you may be getting a little bit anxious right now i know it's that you're shaking your leg is there anything that you're worried about right now um i just don't want to like upset my parents and make them feel like i'm a disappointment to them if i don't do well okay is that something that you're often worried about usually because i don't want them to think like they shouldn't have had me because i'm so worthless to them okay that's quite a heavy worry to be carrying really have you talked to them about this worry no you haven't said it to them before how do you think they might react if they did know that you felt this way they'd probably say like as long as i do well i'll be fine like and they'll love me if i do well in my exams and go to a good sixth form and get good grades so you think that maybe they wouldn't love you if you didn't do well go to a good sick form i don't see how they would want to if i was so worthless and useless at whatever i do okay so it sounds like you're really worried about losing your parents love and approval and you think that by passing these exams you will you will kind of secure that love and approval from them
