Psychological Assessment: Interviews, Psychological Tests, and Observations


so this lesson uh is broken up into three sections right there is assessment diagnosis and treatment when we talk about a sequence we go in that particular order because with a clinical assessment we're trying to determine whether an individual meets the criteria for a particular mental health condition sometimes the results suggest that there is no diagnosis right there are times when a diagnosis is not warranted and those individuals will report back what our findings were and hey you know I diagnose you with quote unquote normal right whatever normal means right uh but there are other individuals who B based on their performance on any number of clinical assessments and we'll go through it uh might meet the criteria for a particular diagnosis whether it's anxiety or depression whether it's Eating Disorders bipolar disorder so uh we could come to a diagnosis and then the diagnosis is very important because it informs the treatment and the treatment is how we address the symptoms related to the diagnosis so notice we're not automatically taking everyone into treatment say yeah we're going to work with you if there's nothing wrong with you that would be unethical to uh Bill insurance or charge a person uh to see you and there's nothing wrong with them and the diagnosis in addition to it being a framework for conceptualizing how you want to approach treatment it also allows other professional to have a shared language so if I were to say uh panic disorder right when I use that diagnosis my colleagues are going to understand what I mean by the term panic disorder right now we will also have to note uh that there are specifiers so I might have to say whether it's with agoraphobia or without agoraphobia uh um and um we also have you know agoraphobia as a potential Standalone diagnosis all right but we'll get there so that is what we mean if I use the language major depressive disorder my colleagues are going to know what major depressive disorder is now I would want to specify whether it's with seasonal onset if we're dealing with uh Seasonal effective disorder uh or if I wanted to specify um with postpartum onset so postpartum depression we might specify and there are a whole host of other specifiers but I'm giving you a little bit of the flavor so when we do our assessment it can lead to a diagnosis in the diagnosis informs the treatment as well as allows for a common or a shared language between professionals so let's start with clinical assessment right so in general an assessment is designed to collect information that we believe is relevant to answering a question or reaching a conclusion when we use the language clinical assessment now we're trying to figure out if there is a clinical diagnosis that is going on and how a person might be ha be behaving perhaps normally or abnormally and why they might be doing that and then uh we could also do an assessment on the effectiveness of the interventions or response to interventions now clinical assessment comes in many forms as you will see as I progress in this video um we have uh clinical interviews psychological tests uh observational uh strategies there's a whole host of ways that we can approach this now what approach we use depends on several things the first thing it depends on is the clinician theoretical orientation projective tests as we uh will talk about come more out of more the psychoanalytic perspective so if you are uh psychoanalytic ically inclined you're going to probably be more likely to use a projective test as part of your clinical assessment whereas a cognitive behavioral therapist will be more likely to use rating scales or inventories um as part of their assessment so your theoretical orientation matters I will also say what your competent in matters so a clinician is going to use an assessment that they know how to administer and then I would also say the referral question matters so yes it is true that the tools you use an assessment depends on theoretic orientation but that is not the only thing it depends on depends on your competencies and uh from an Ethics point of view we are only allowed to administer instruments that we are competent in administering uh and as I said whatever the referral question is that's going to inform the type of tools you use so let's start with clinical interviews when we say clinical interviews typically we're meeting face to face although I will tell you that du postco uh there's a lot more clinical interviewing and the full course of therapy happening virtually but uh clinical interviewing would typically occur face to face and that would be your first Contact between the the client and the therapist and you would take a a detailed history or what we call a psychosocial on a client we would focus on things like one's home life uh educational attainment and functioning uh work history substance use history family history developmental history legal history and so forth right so that's not all of the areas we would focus on but we're trying to get a complete picture of who the client is now clinical interviews can occur in many forms it can be a fully structured interview where all of your questions are identical for everyone the problem with that is that if you do that you might miss some of the important follow-up questions we also have something called an unstructured clinical interview where it's conversational and free flowing and it's tailored to the individual but most of us in practice use what's called a semi-structured interview process and when we say semi-structured there are certain questions we're going to ask everybody but the follow-up questions are dependent on your answer so if I were to ask a client related to a substance use history uh have you ever tried drugs and alcohol and they say no there's no need to follow up beyond that you can move to the next area of your assessment but if they say yes well that's going to open up more curiosity for me I might say okay well what substances have you tried and when did you when was the earliest time you've tried it are are you currently using any of these substances how frequently are you using the substances have you had any kind of like Fallout or problem as a function of the substance of abuse have you received any earlier treatment linked to substances of abuse all of these questions pop into my head as immediate follow-ups based on an answer of yes right so a semi-structured interview yeah we might start off with the first question the same uh but then we go deeper into all of the domains in accordance with where our client is and what they say all right now I talked to you that a uh interview can be structured or unstructured or what I call semi-structured interview uh when you're using either an unstructured or a a semi-structured interview you're more likely to ask open-ended questions and open-ended questions there's not a right or wrong answer and the person can paint whatever picture they want with um open-ended questions whereas with structured interviews sometimes they are manualized questionnaires we'll talk about questionnaires uh there might be lier scales uh and it really uh constrains what you're trying to accomplish another thing that you're going to take as part of the interview is something called a mental status exam and a mental status exam is a general assessment of functioning uh there are some mental status exams that focus more on cognition and orientation so uh the full scen mini mental status exam is a good example of one where it's used in many inpatient or Hospital settings to determine orientation do you know what today's date is right and we would measure day month year you could get up to three points uh do you know where you are uh so uh they might say yeah I'm in Staten Island University Hospital right so they will know where they are uh and a whole host of other things we might do um number sequencing right so subtract by seven starting with 100 as a you know cognitive process but when we assess mental status we're also assessing other parts of mental status so I'm going to assess your appearance do you look appropriately addressed for the interview so if a person is uh Dressed uh I don't know in shorts in the winter we might say okay well that seems pretty peculiar unless they said yeah I just came from the gym forgive my attire if a person as um I don't know um excessive amounts of makeup and they're missing one earring we might inquire about that right so your appearance matters we also listen to your speech patterns so are you able to communicate effectively are you speaking in a logical and linear way are you speaking rapidly so it goes like this blah blah blah blah blah right so is there pressured speech so someone speaking too rapidly or not able to take a breath or it seems like you they're not catching their breath when speaking we pay attention to that we pay attention to what's called mood and affect we might ask a person how are you feeling and a person might say okay I'm feeling fine or I'm feeling good well that's the mood is what's going on inside the individual where the affect is what the person looks like and it is not uncommon for a person to report their internal emotion differently than how they present outward so we would write in our mental status exam portion that mood is inconsistent with affect right and then we would specify um client reported feeling happy but affect appeared sad or Solen right and so forth so mental status exam now we're we're Als in addition to the social domains like home life school work now we're tapping into what's going on internally we also tap into uh suicidal and homicidal ideations uh whether there is an ideation intent or plan we also tap in whether there are means to complete some form of suicide or homicide so that's the mental status exam and it's pretty free flowing now the folstein is a structured mental status exam whereas many of us use our clinical interviewing to tap into the domains that I just talked to you about so let's talk about test right so we talked about um interviews now we'll talk about test and there are hundreds of different tests available for a person to use and they come in a variety of forms projective test personality inventories response inventories uh psychophysiological exams neuros pych exams intelligence exams and so forth now I said to you that the kind of assessment you're going to do depends on the referral question so if if I had um the question whether a child in school had a learning disord order right would I give them a personality inventory the answer is no I probably would give them an IQ test I would also give them an achievement test and I would compare uh the consistency or relative inconsistency between these two and generally speaking uh a learning disability or disorder can be detected when uh the overall scores are about one and a half standard deviations apart so that's an example of how I might use intelligence testing or achievement testing if I were trying to understand whether or not a person was competent to to stand for trial well I'm going to use more forensically based tests I might use some personality inventories uh I might use some risk assessment tools uh recidivism tools um in addition to as I said um competency exams so your referral question is going to inform the test you use as well now I put on the bottom of the slide that there is this tremendous resource uh for anyone who is interested called the mental measurement ments yearbook and the mental measurements yearbook is published I want to say every two years and it's updated for any new instrument that is created or any updates on instruments and it provides a solid summary of what the instrument does and it'll talk about the relative reliability and validity of the instrument so the mental measurements yearbook is a great resource for those of us in in the field as well the American Psychological Association also created their own um database in competition with the mental measurements yearbook called psych test and psych test is another one of these tools where if you're looking for an instrument for any particular referral question you can pretty much find it and what it will do is it'll give you the general information about the tests and many of um the PDFs will also give you a copy of the instrument assuming that it's not copyright protected so let's talk about projective tests right so I said your theoretic orientation is going to impact how you uh administer test and the kind of test you use but what is a projected test a projective test by definition is when you present some ambiguous stimulus and it's by Design you're doing this on purpose so that a person can project out their personality and you might follow it up with open-ended questions or instructions and as I said projective tests are very common with psychoanalytic or psychodynamic practitioners and there are examples of of projective tests here like the ink blot test the Thematic app perception test uh sentence completion and drawing so here is an example of an inklot now the roar shock is probably the most popular uh ink blot but there are others so if I were to administer the roar shock well I would be giving a series of 10 cards with ink blots on them some of the cards are purely black and white some of the cards are grayscale and some of the cards are color as you see on the right of this slide and I would go through each of the 10 cards and I would ask them tell me what you see in this card and then I would ask the person show me where they see it in the card now I would go go through all 10 cards asking for what the person sees and then go back a second time and say okay on card one you said you saw dot dot dot can you show me where you saw it uh so that I can code it because the roar shock test has a pretty sophisticated coding system and one of the coding systems that I recommend is called the exner coding system and there are computerized software that you can plug in what the person said where they said it uh and the kind of response they gave you and it will spit out a personality profile now for the sake of demonstration and a little bit of fun can anyone give me something they might see in here and before you answer I will tell you you cannot diagnose any anything from a single card so you don't have to worry about me or your peers judging you based on your response right and I will say that most people see more than one thing in a card so I might say is there anything else you see so is there anyone in a class who wants to tell me something they might see let's see some someone in a chat said they saw a crab uh a spider a beetle a bug and my assumption is that that's at the center of the page right and someone said they saw an eyeball that makes sense too right a brain right there are a lot of different answers coming into the chat the red looks like a poppy flower uh so yeah now none of your answers are out of the ordinary these are actually common responses to this card most people see one form of a flower another with the red right most people see some kind of animal in the center nothing wrong with any of your answers uh so I want you to know that as well but let's say someone said um I see a Lamborghini well I don't know if you can make this picture into Lamborghini but I can't so we would go through the back of the manual which will tell you what the common responses are and what's considered an atypical response and we would write it down and if a person gave a series of atypical responses that would suggest perhaps their orientation or cognition was distorted there could be some um parietal low brain damage perhaps or some kind of other psychological disturbance based on uh how they depicted this card um but even when we use projective personality tests like the roar shock we don't use it exclusively we're going to use it as part of a battery and we're going to see if there's consistency through it now I will share a story I was um doing my externship at South Beach Psychiatric Center in Staten Island and I was given the task of giving uh a personality assessment to one of the residents and this person reported they saw a vagina in all 10 cards and they showed me where they thought they saw and everything and obviously that's considered an atypical response uh there is one card where it's actually considered an appropriate answer or or a common answer but the other nine cards it's not and we we were left with the question well why did they say that it were they trying to fake the test or did they actually have a hypersexualized view and based on other data points it turned out that this individual had a hypersexualized view and they were diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder so it all kind of came together but um the answers that were given in the chat are perfectly acceptable common answers here's another exam the Thematic Apperception Test or the tat there is a child or children's version of this test called the cat children's Apperception Test it is slightly different and it's the pictures are more tailored to children now Henry Murray came up with this test and he wanted to see how people resolve conflict so in many cards there's multiple people in the card the tat has a series of 30 cards you do not give all 30 cards similar to the roar shock test there is a standard battery and the standard battery is uh a series of 10 cards but you might say well if that's the standard battery why were there 30 cards all together the answer is that you can swap out some cards based on a referral question to assess that now when we present a card to a person we're going to say I'm presenting you a card and I would like you to create a story based on this card that has a beginning middle end and a thought and a feeling that comes up and we would invite them to share a story and we're going to write Verbatim what they said so word for word what they said because that's going to be important when we code this later because we need to make sure that there W was a beginning middle end we need to be able to identify patterns of thoughts or patterns of emotions right because if you see the first word is Thematic Apperception Test so we're looking for themes so once again a single card is not going to be predictive of Personality similar to uh the roar shock and the tat alone is not sufficient to do a personality assessment so I'd like to invite someone uh to uh share a story based on this card that has a beginning middle end a thought and a feeling um and if you could you know instead of using the chat because this will be a lot harder if you could unmute yourself um or raise your hand and I can call on you to to do so so is there anyone who would like to share a story based on this card going once going twice going three times and we're done now I will tell you the common stories that come up are linked to parent child conflict and that kind of makes sense to you right because there there is an older figure and a younger figure uh the younger figure um is by design a little bit more ambiguous in their gender but there is a slightly higher proportion of people who report the younger person in the picture is female so it's often times uh motherdaughter conflict that comes out of this you also have um you know some themes of uh Sleeping Beauty right with the apple right so the W the older woman is sometimes depicted as a witch um and then you have another common theme that people talk about reminiscing about one's youth so sometimes people tell the story Through The Eyes of the older woman saying that she's looking back to it's almost like a flashback to her youth so these are common responses uh and someone said they thought it looked like a creepy nun possibly yeah so if you gave a story around that uh that would be a pretty interesting interesting story now you might say what is the benefit of the beginning middle and end usually the conflict is based on the story with the beginning and the middle the end of the story gives you the Insight of conflict resolution uh and it's a really cool test right so there is no objective right or wrong answer so uh your colleague who put in a chat that looks like a creepy nun okay that's fine there's no right or wrong answer here um also could look like a stalker right someone else said so but yeah the story itself we care about how you string stories together and how you resolve conflict now the thought and the feeling that part of the tat also should make a lot of sense to you because we're looking for patterns of thoughts patterns of emotions we code your emotions uh let's say out of the 10 cards we give you eight out of the 10 cards uh depict some form of a negative emotion that would be important to put in the assessment because it could reflect either some kind of depressed mood or disregulated mood right and it's a data point just like every other instrument we're going to use it's a data point to inform other parts of our assessment there are other things that people do so there's a sentence completion task so you might give a a sheet of paper uh and you ask a person to complete the sentence uh so I wish dot dot dot so as students you might say I wish the class was over now I don't think that's uh the case but you could fill it in any way you want my father dot dot dot and what you're doing is you're inviting the person uh to share what's going on internally and you could look a little bit more into their world we also have things like picture drawing tasks so like draw a person when we ask you to draw a person and then draw a person of the opposite sex that's designed to give us some kind of view of the self and when you draw a picture we believe that you're drawing yourself now there is a more sophisticated uh set of drawings the house tree person test uh that happens uh a lot of police departments use that as a projective test so the house is more of a depiction of your early childhood and your home life your tree is more of your developmental history and your extended friendships and relationships and the person is your view of yourself right so and then we interpret size location Etc so let's say a person Drew uh drew a picture of an individual very small they have a eight half by 11 piece of paper and then they draw this person really really small and perhaps to the corner of the page well we might say that hey this could indicate poor self-esteem right because they view themselves very small and they view themselves very distant right because most people are going to use the vast majority of the paper and they're going to draw themselves as a reasonable size now notice we're not not asking a person draw a picture of yourself we just say draw a person and we infer that this is uh how you view yourself right it's pretty cool cool tactic um if a person drew a house uh I had this as an example a person drew a house uh on the top of a hill kind of hanging at the top angled outward and it this person had previous suicide attempts and was recently suicidal well the interpretation of that picture is perhaps that symbolic of thoughts of suicide right um and so forth now these are our projective tests before I move on I will say the strength or strengths of projective test is that they're intentionally ambiguous so we can tap into the recesses of your personality there is no right or wrong answer objectively so those are some of the real benefits the criticisms of projective tests are in terms of whether my interpretation would be consistent with the next clinicians so there are real questions about reliability and validity of objective tests used in isolation so let's talk about other uh personality inventories well there's a whole host of Personality inventories but you'll probably be most familiar with the mmpi the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory um which has over 500 questions that are true or false and it Taps into multiple clinical areas and I think it's very important to emphasize when we use the word inventory it has to tap into multiple domains right now in addition so there are 10 clinical scales as it relates to the mmpi in addition to the clinical scales we also measure the validity of your answer ansers and the mmpi is a really cool instrument because uh we can tap into a bias for True right so there's a true response uh uh subscale so if a person says true excessively that could be elevated or flagged we also see that there are several items that ask the same or very similar questions so we have a variable response uh which means that the person is inconsistent in their answers we have a a way of detecting whether a person is faking good or exaggerating their symptoms and faking bad we have a way of detecting defensiveness we have a way of detecting boredom so the mmpi is a really powerful instrument and as a function of giving it first we look at the validity scales and if it's a valid um assessment then we look at what's called the two-point code now I'll give you uh this is an example of a profile and if I were to say well what's the two-point code the twoo code would be this individual's a 27 now how do I know this is the twoo code for this individual is a 27 well if you look at the two highest scores uh the Peaks are uh two and seven so this person would likely present as an individual with major depressive disorder and some OCD right so and I go through it you'll notice that uh we have the list of scales the 10 clinical scales but most of us when we write the reports we don't use the labels because labels can be stigmatizing we say scale one scale two all the way to scale uh 10 or zero right and um when you have two standard deviations of elevation we consider that clinically uh significant now there are other people who use 65 as a threshold not 70 and it makes sense based on what I said about one and a half standard deviations if the tcore is supposed to be 50 and a standard deviation is 10 the difference between 65 and 50 is 15 so that's one and a half standard deviations so some people use 70 some people use use 65 as their marker of a clinically elevated scale and from this notice how I said this person likely would meet the criteria for major depressive disorder and OCD or obsessive compulsive disorder well that is revealed in this profile now um psychasthenia which which is scale seven or the PT scale right that is OCD that's a fancy way for saying OCD but I also say we we use the scale number not the label because let's look at scale four scale four is referred to as Psychopathic deviant and if we're looking at a two-point code scale four in isolation would not indicate a person who has antisocial personality disorder there have to be other factors elevated uh for that diagnosis but so what does this deviance really reflect it could reflect some criminality it could reflect some moral uh or ethical deficits but it could also reflect a person who beats to to their own drum who uh is kind of eccentric and doesn't have a diagnosis and I say that because imagine you told a a person your scale for Psychopathic deviant was elevated and all you meant was that they beat to their own drum or they're eccentric that wouldn't be nice to use those words so that's why we would say scale four in that case so I said we have the ability to detect uh accuracy or validity so we have the L scale uh which measures faking good and you might ask yourself well why would a person want to fake good the answer is pretty simple people fake good when their goal is for social approval so the m mmpi is also used as a predictor of suitability for the police force right so you might exaggerate how ethical or how good you are because you want to present yourself in an overly positive way faking bad you might also say hey that doesn't make sense either why would a person want to make themselves look worse than they really are well if a person is trying to avoid something like legal liability or responsibility a person might fake that they're worse off or in other settings if there is some kind of Damages case a person might want to present themselves as more physically or emotionally damaged because they'll get a higher payout the uh the lawsuit will get more money so sometimes people fake bad as well and then there are people who are very sensitive to criticism so we have 30 items that are designed to tap into defensiveness so we have our validity scales I also said we have a the ability to measure boredom so there's something called the back page in frequency scale that that can detect whether as the test went on from the beginning or the first half of the test to the second half of the test whether you started to answer in an uh inconsistent or um unreliable way so we can detect if a person got bored and just started randomly responding we also pay attention to how many items you leave blank in principle if a person leaves 10 items blank they're supposed to uh invalidate the test most of us don't do that before before we consider invalidating a test we look at the questions and we want to know if there's a pattern in the kinds of questions that a person left blank because sometimes when a person says cannot say or left blank there's a reason why they're doing that uh and it could be that there's some kind of trauma so let's say all 10 questions had to do with early childhood development well that could re reveal something if they intentionally left those items Blank That's the mmpi now I will tell you that the mmpi is not the only uh broad personality inventory we have the pii we have the mcmi and I'm I know I'm throwing out a bunch of acronyms or letters but one of the biggest criticisms of the mmpi is it doesn't have the same strength of identifying personality disorders as let's say the Milan clinical multiaxial inventory so the mcmi does a much better job at detecting um personality disorders the pii uh does a better job at getting Spectrum based responses because the mmpi was true and false right so the p is from strongly agree to strongly disagree and it's a shorter test as well so there are reasons why we might use a different personality inventory now person personality inventories are broad covering many clinical domains we also have a response inventory or response questionnaire and that's focusing on one area of functioning so something like the Beck depression inventory so the Beck depression inventory is only measuring depression whereas the mmpi measured depression it measured uh Mania so bipolar disorder it measured OCD it measured a whole bunch of other things the BDI or Beck depression inventory is only measuring uh depression and response inventories are usually based on self-re support and you can tap into one's emotions one's thoughts or cognitions and one's social skills now one of the problems with self-report is the social desirability we talked about so uh we have the risk of someone lying right as I said on the mmpi we wanted to make sure that the person wasn't faking good or faking bad or being overly defensive uh but response inventories have that same problem of honesty we also have uh psychophysiological tests so now we're linking your uh bodily response or uh physiological response to some kind of psychological condition so your heart rate your heart rate is a good indicator of sympathetic arousal um so if you have a significantly elevated heart rate that could indicate levels of anxiety or stress Related Disorders blood pressure is another measure we use uh body temperature the galvanic skin response which is sweat muscle tension all of these are data points that could reflect a psychological disorder now you probably have heard of the polygraph or the lie detector test and the lie detector test capitalizes on both muscle contraction and sweating so uh that's part of how we detect some kind of problem now there are other tests that we use right so you might see an EEG Electro andram which is designed to measure the firing of neurons in the brain well that would be useful at detecting sleep Related Disorders and uh seizures right so uh an EEG is useful for that a CAT scan or an MRI these are still images so they're static images which give you a picture of the brain or parts of the brain and uh we can detect all kinds of structural abnormalities based on a CT scan or an mrii uh so we can detect Alzheimer's due to some kind of atrophy to the hippocampus or the amydala and so forth so we can use CT scans we can use MRIs as still pictures now the Pet Scan and the MRI these are Dynamic tests which means that you're measuring the brain's functioning while a person is doing a task so a pet skin is uh looking at radioactive dye and the glowing of various parts of the brain whereas an fmri is looking at blood flow at to different parts of the brain so there are a lot of instruments so now with the Pet Scan and in fmri we can detect some form of physiological um pathology so um before I go to neuros pych tests I will also say a criticism of the physiological or uh neurological tests is that they oftentimes use equipment that are anxiety-provoking so you can induce anxiety when a person's getting a CAT scan you can induce anxiety when a person's doing an EEG and if you're trying to get a valid measure it's problematic the nice thing about the psychophysiological methods or the neurological test is that we're able to link the brain to your psychological functioning we're also able to tap into um segments of the population that cannot communicate so um neurological or psychophysiological tests you can use with infants even if a person is nonverbal or preverbal we also have something called neuropsychological tests and again neuros pychological tests come in many forms so it could be your executive fun in decision making planning it could be your spatial or perceptual awareness it could be motor functioning and so forth and what you're looking at here is a picture of a person who has brain damage right and we gave them uh the Bender uh visual motor Gestalt test or what we just call the bender and we give them a series of cards and we ask them to do a direct copy of whatever they see on the card and what happens is if there are some spatial related brain damage you're going to see problems like at the top where the diamond is not fully closed you're going to see rotations you're going to see conversions omissions uh extensions beyond what the picture actually was so if you were guessing you know you would suggest that this person has uh deficits in spatial reasoning right and perhaps the parietal lobe is damaged here now the uh Bender there is a second one which also Taps into memory where you ask people to reproduce from memory some of the shapes as well so we we have a direct copy and then a uh a recall of the shapes so the Bender is a good example of just one neuros test then we have intelligence tests intelligence tests measure your intellectual ability uh today they tap into both verbal and non-verbal skills typically and when we talk about intelligence you're going to get what's called an IQ score which is your general intelligence quotient and we consider IQ to be 100 that's average with a standard deviation of 15 therefore if a person is two standard deviations above or below 100 we would say that they have a a significantly different or atypical intelligence so let's take a person who has an IQ of 130 or above well we colloquially refer to this person as a genius right their IQ is significantly higher than average if a person has an IQ two standard deviations below the mean that would be an IQ of 70 so an IQ of 70 or below coupled with deficits in adaptive functioning would indicate some kind of intellectual disability what used to be referred to as mental retardation uh so an in intellectual disability or intellectual developmental disorder right that's the language we're using today now there are many different intelligence tests on the market uh the most popular ones today are the Wexler tests although there's uh the Stanford Benet test which is another really good one there's the Bailey uh scales for infant intelligence there's the Woodcock Johnson uh as another one that's really really popular and good but let's talk about the Wexler test so the Wexler test uh happened in response to the Stanford Benet and I'm not going to go into the early history of intelligence testing and how Alfred Benet uh formulated the test and how it was transformed but David wex basically felt that we can do a better job at assessing intelligence across the age spectrum and one of the first things he did was divide uh the intelligence tests into three separate ones the whipsy Whisk and waist and you will see that there are different age brackets where a person can take a test so the whipsy does a really good job and you can assess intelligence at 2 and a half years old all the way up to seven years old the Whisk is from six years old to 16 years old or 16 years 11 months to be more specific and then we have the waist which is 16 years to 90 or 90 years 11 months so we have a broad range of instruments in the Wexler test family for different age brackets now what happens if you have a person that's on the the cut off right let's say you have a six-year-old or a 16-year-old which intelligence test would you give them the answer is it doesn't matter you if you have a six-year-old you could give the whipsy or the Whisk and you're going to get roughly the same IQ score so it isn't just about accumulated knowledge IQ is aptitude or potential so a six-year-old taking the whipsy would get roughly the same IQ as if they took the Whisk because these are standardized tests and when I say standardized that means the administration of the test is standardized so we say the same prompts we give the same questions but we also rely on a standardization sample to create the Norms so we take thousands of kids and we figure out what the average response at a given age bracket should be so whether you gave the whipsy or the Whisk the common response at the age bracket is going to be where it's going to be same thing if you have a 16-year-old you could give the Whisk or the waist and it really wouldn't matter uh because you're going to get roughly the same result now the Wexler tests also have performance elements to them and when we say performance these are referred to as nonverbal uh scores we have verbal aspects of intelligence and we have uh composite scores or or general indices of performance so intelligence testing is far more sophisticated than where we started now a big criticism of intelligence before I move to clinical observations is that intelligence testing still does have some biases involved in it so there are cultural biases with the verbal elements so there are uh people have pushed for nonverbal intelligence scales and we have those we have the test of non-verbal intelligence and many others um Raven's Progressive matrices is another one in an intelligence test that doesn't require uh verbal responses uh so if you have a non-verbal child or you're worried about cultural biases this could be useful we also have so I talked to you about the interview process I talked to you about the testing process now let's talk about the observation which is the third General section of assessment so we can observe Behavior through a naturalistic analog or self monitoring ways a naturalistic observation is where you're observing a child perform in a real world environment or it doesn't actually have to be a child it can be an adult as well but let's say we're talking about a child we might observe a child in a classroom well a classroom is a natural environment a real world environment we might sit at the back of the classroom and see how the child interacts with other classmates and that would be a naturalistic observation it is designed to happen in the real world so that you can get uh more generalizable or representative responses so we could focus on parent child teacher student child child interactions uh we also can have what's called a participant Observer where the clinician interacts with the child directly versus watching the child from afar one of the criticisms of the participant Observer is the influence of the person observing could alter the behavior versus watching from afar they're going to behave more naturally so that's naturalistic then we have something called an analog observation an analog observation is observing someone in a more artificial environment so if I was a clinical researcher I might have a family come into um my lab and I might sit them in a circle and and leave the room and just observe how they interact with one another from afar or I could ask them to do a task in the lab or I can have one-way mirrors right if you're a researcher you might once again not want the person to know you're watching them but the difference between a naturalistic and an analog observation is that the analog observation occurs in a more artificial environment you can control for some biases with the artificial environment but the generalizability you get from a naturalistic observation is reduced with an analog observation and then last but not least we have something called self-monitoring and self-monitoring is we invite a person to observe their own actions so we might um ask a person to engage in journaling or writing a log remember the person with panic disorder I might have them write the date of the panic attack what they were doing before the panic attack how long the panic attack lasted and what they did to resolve the panic attack and that it that is a way of logging panic disorder but getting a sense as to what is the frequency of panic attacks what are your triggers of panic attacks what are your coping strategies that work and so forth so self-monitoring can be done through um journaling we might have a thought record if some we're working on some cognitive restructuring task or there is a form of self-monitoring where we uh either text or page a person say okay can you write what you're doing now the problem with self-monitoring is that people are inconsistent with writing in what they were doing or observing their own actions and people filter their observations so that's clinical observations now I'm going to stop uh the recording here but as you can see we have ways of doing assessment that come in the form of interviewing come in a form of psychological assessment or testing and through observation both direct or indirect observation once we get all of this information we're able to move to the concept of a diagnosis but let me stop here for the moment
