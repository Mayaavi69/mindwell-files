Therapy Questions for Depression and Anxiety
Many therapies designed for treating depression zero in on the problems with thinking, both about us and the world around us.
While there may be many reasons for that, the biggest value of therapy is in creating awareness of the habits of mind that often don’t serve us.
The below questionnaire identifies typical symptoms of depression and is adapted from the Patient Health Questionnaire (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, & Löwe, 2010).
Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?

Apply a score as follows:
* 1 for Not at all;
* 2 for Several days;
* 3 for More than half the days and
How often does the following problems bother you?Score1.Little interest or pleasure in doing things.___2.Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.___3.Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.___4.Feeling tired or having little energy.___5.Poor appetite or overeating.___6.Feeling bad about yourself—or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down.___7.Trouble concentrating on things such as reading the newspaper or watching television.___8.Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed. Or the opposite—being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual.___9.Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way.* 4 for Nearly every day.

If you experience any of the problems above, how difficult have they made it for you to do your work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people?
* Not difficult at all
* Somewhat difficult
* Very difficult
* Extremely difficult
Many forms of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), some discussed below, address the problems in thinking associated with depression. The good news is that these problematic thinking patterns can be adequately assessed and treated.
One such example is the measure of pessimism present in clients’ interpretations of life events as marked by their attribution or explanatory style.
Several questionnaires help therapists analyze the content of their clients’ perceptions such as Attributional Style Questionnaire (Peterson et al., 1982), the Children’s Attributional Style Questionnaire (Kaslow, Tannenbaum, & Seligman, 1978) and the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations Technique (Peterson, Schulman, Castellon, & Seligman, 1992).
Below is an example of how to adopt these assessments to real-life situations.
Instructions:
Ask the client to imagine as vividly as possible an event, such as having a serious argument with a family member or any other appropriate scenario best suited to the client’s situation.
Let the client indicate the major cause(s) of the event and then ask them to answer three follow-up questions regarding their chosen explanatory options.
A. Please select from below the important reasons that caused the above event. You may choose more than one:
* Personality problems
* Emotional problems
* Influence of past experience or feelings
* Being treated unfairly
* Communication problems
* Misunderstandings
* Discrepancies in mutual expectations
* Other reasons
* B. Are the causes you selected due to something about you or to something about other people or circumstances?
* C. In the future, when facing a similar event, will these causes be present again?
* D. Are the causes something that had an influence on only the above event, or do they also influence other areas of your life?
Other frequently used measures for depression and anxiety include the Beck Depression Inventory (Dozois & Covin, 2004) and the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 2010). The rating scale below has been adopted from part of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory.
Read the statements below and indicate how much these apply to how you feel and think on a typical day. Apply a score of 1 for Never; 2 for Sometimes; 3 for Frequently and 4 for Almost always.

How often do you feel or think the following:ScoreI feel pleasant.___I feel nervous and restless.___I feel satisfied with myself.___I wish I could be as happy as others seem to be.___I feel like a failure.___I feel rested.___I am “calm, cool, and collected.”___I feel that difficulties are piling up so that I cannot overcome them.___I worry too much over something that really doesn’t matter.___I am happy.___I have disturbing thoughts.___I lack self-confidence.___I feel secure.___I make decisions easily.___I feel inadequate.___I am content.___Some unimportant thought runs through my mind and bothers me.___I take disappointments so keenly that I can’t put them out of my mind.___I am a steady person.___I get in a state of tension or turmoil as I think over my recent concerns.___
Therapy questions for anxiety will often need to include probing into somatic symptoms and bringing awareness to the body for signals of onset of anxiety. Treatment for anxiety often also includes techniques for learning relaxation that can be used when the anxiety suddenly strikes.
Gestalt Therapy may be a helpful approach to combating somatic symptoms of anxiety (see below).
Questions to work with anxiety can also focus on reframing our perceptions of stress, as studies show that when we view stress as physically harmful, it tends to have a more detrimental effect on our health than when we see stress as information or an opportunity to rise to the occasion (McGonigal, 2015).
CBT and solution-focused therapies discussed below can be applied to specific behavioral patterns associated with anxiety-inducing thinking patterns and perceptions
