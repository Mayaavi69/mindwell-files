Assumptions in Psychological Testing and Assessment

I'm going to cover assumptions in psychological testing one of the most frequently requested topics one of the most important topics like assessment one of my personal favorites as well right so let's get started no hopefully uh making successful in first live stream not then until um next year live stream all right see you again let us begin so what will this topic cover no if assumptions in Psych assessment the topic this talks about some of the things that we should keep in mind whenever we do psychological testing and assessment a psychology professionals or psychometricians psychologists conducting assessment is one of our functions aside from for psychology aside from doing therapy for psychometricians and psychologists aside from doing um aside from our other functions okay psychological testing and whenever we do psychological testing and assessment foreign okay and I will talk about these assumptions this afternoon right so first and foremost before we before I talk about the different assumptions in psychological testing and assessment first let's have a quick recap now how do we use assessment again what is the purpose of doing uh assessment so for those um for our quick recap you know these are some questions that we can answer by doing psychological testing and assessment for example is this person competent to stand trial particularly so forensic setting the nothing legally speaking saying Basha mentally healthy Basha to stand trial in the i o setting we use assessment to determine who should be hired who should be transferred who should be promoted or even who should be fired or terminated in the educational setting we use assessment to determine who deserves um to get a scholarship who deserves to be a scholar or going back to forensic um all in all we do testing and assessment in order for us to make decisions decision making young primary primary reasons testing and assessment introduction to psych assessment which is why we will not focus on these today instead we will focus on the assumptions so with this being said now knowing that we use assessment to make decisions crucial decisions strengths and limitations of testing and assessment okay so again let's now talk about the seven assumptions in psychological assessment beginning with starting with assumption number one our first assumption inside testing is that psychological traits and States exist abnormal psychology okay uh and we also talk about traits in theories of personality traits so States but before that before that now what is the meaning of psychological traits and States exists it means that um a psychology student a psychology practitioners we believe that psychological traits and States NATO even though Hindi not incident even though they are not directly observable okay Alibaba a psychology Professional Psychology practitioners We Believe intelligence is okay and one person can be described as intelligent one person can be described as more intelligent than another person and the same goes for other constructs out there like extroversion consensuousness and so on you know for now let me differentiate psychological traits and States no so when we say psychological um trait it's an enduring characteristic right a distinguishable enduring way in which one individual varies from another so for example here is a personality extroversion agreeableness and then you wrote this exam all right now um to understand to understand the personality of an individual like as an extroverted okay uh is he or she a yes person agreeable Basha is he or she calm or neurotic all right they're not expected to change rather it expected for a long period period of time traits are believed to be stable Elementary until adults um introvert okay so we differ but aside from that we also differences States less enduring but the last Panama what you feel at present may not be the same tomorrow or two days from now or three days from now La Luna one week from now States foreign okay even though they are less enduring we also differ in terms of states okay we believe that both of them exist and we believe that both of them can be used to understand individual differences foreign foreign can explain why you are happy today well the construct is in short your assumption number one psychological constructs exists so when we say construct this is something that Hindi nakikita directly okay but you know that it can be used to understand and explain behavior intelligence extroversion neuroticism perfectionism all right um happiness life satisfaction and so on all right we are concerned with these constructs even though we cannot directly observe them a psychology Majors a psychology students intelligence all right and they can be used in understanding individual differences now if people will question is that young Behavior okay the fact that we differ in terms of behavior must Ard is the fact that this constructs exist okay okay I guess that would be enough no for for assumption number one no just let me know if you have questions now you can chat now so I can try to answer them and clarify them no okay it's again now um the second assumption is that they exist constructs exist now in Assumption number two psychological traits and States can be Quantified and measured okay okay foreign it's about measurement Okay so the next thing that we should ask is that can we measure these constructs say for example my research okay parenting okay perfectionism for example sure number two okay let us ask ourselves how can we measure these constructs such as happiness of esteem social anxiety hope and so on okay tools [Music] measuring devices okay psychological test the reason why in a psychological test is because we want to measure a construct right say for example 2020 the construct of Zoom fatigue emerged a lot of people are reporting that they're feeling what we call Zoom fatigue okay now the question is how can we scientifically study zumbati which is why like tests that can measure Zoom fatigue okay so in order for us to scientifically study a construct it needs to be measurable it it should be measured it should be Quantified and to quantify something to measure something we will have to make use of a certain measuring device in our case we rely heavily on psychological test psychological testing and assessment all right so for every construct out there you know personally for every concept out there contests that can measure the construct if you want to study that monster okay it's again now speaking of tests now let's go to assumption number three this is my personal favorite assumption test related Behavior predicts non-test related Behavior okay we make use of psychological assessment to make decisions okay [Music] assessment to make decisions psychological assessment okay now um assessment okay because we believe that according to Success okay it reveals something about you outside the testing room okay inside the testing room says something about you outside the testing room entrance exam it's because we'll say something about who you will be in the future we'll say something about your behavior outside this testing room and it will help us make meaningful predictions this is my personal favorite hiring Nursery so hiring NASA some industrial setting is actually so our goal here not the objective of the test is to provide some indication of other aspects of the examinist behavior outside this testing room say for example if the taken a neopi r and then it turned out on a neurotic then we can say that outside the testing room you are the kind of persona mobile okay reason you're the kind of person nah smart you're the kind of person that critical thinking and so on okay ideally the task in the test should mimic the actual behaviors that the test is attempting to understand now in order for this assumption is exercises okay so for example it's possible when you become a teacher so the same applies for tests okay in order for it to meaningfully predict to accurately predict okay your behavior outside the testing room okay yeah in real life okay for example if you want to measure an individual's mathematical ability mathematical abilities okay yeah right other than that no that's the the results of the test can be used to make predictions about the future okay so as mentioned earlier now which is why we want um which is why um for example in the HR setting in the educational setting because they will tell us no if in the future this person will perform well for example and so on or in some cases in forensics in those cases instead of predicting Behavior the role of the test is even to post dick behavior when we say in order for you to verify psychological tests okay so say for example no how will you make sure that this individual is really uh mentally incapable device is among the grounds for annulment psychologically capable mental capacity is questionable so in order for you to verify this no as a psychologist you can do assessment you are reasoning out that during the time of the crime the the accused individual no it's not in the right frame of mind so in order for the court to really verify that they can ask a psychologist to conduct assessment to know if psychological um concerns no that can be a hindrance for him or her to understand what is right and what is wrong at the time right okay so it can also be used now for that purpose it's not only it's not always about predicting it can also be used in understanding what has already happened in the past okay yeah to verify something now when you're particularly in the forensic setting now um let's go to number four okay another very important assumption is that tests and other measurement techniques sub strengths and weaknesses okay so what does the what does this mean okay okay okay because competent test users understand a great deal about the test that they use you know the limitations for example when used in the Philippine setting fighting me issues when it comes to language barrier cultural cross-cultural applicability and so on okay competent test users understand how a test was devedo the circumstances under which it is appropriate to administer the tests how the test should be administered and to whom and how the test results should be interpreted okay assessment okay in order for us to to be more accurate No in our decisions in our evaluations okay you have to ask yourself is this me if your client is a child or is this for adult use if your client is not proficient with English the circumstances under which it is appropriate to administer the tests um okay it is not appropriate say for example setting okay to diagnosis meeting as an entrance as an entrance exam okay next how the test should be administered what if you administered it by group but the test is supposed to be administered one by one or individually okay so we should understand this no as I could ask we should understand a psychology practitioners and a psychology students okay tests have strengths and weaknesses okay competent test users know the tools that they are using this may be an exaggerated example pero for example you cannot use a pregnancy test to understand an individual's personality you cannot use an intelligence test to understand or to measure a person's anxiety because that is not the purpose that's not the purpose of the test that is an intelligence assumption okay assumptions currency for example observation you also rely on case history okay you also look into other sources of information and that is because tests and other measurement techniques hamstrings and weaknesses okay so to control okay to to take into account these weaknesses we make use of several Tools in assessment believing that young using the test or using the interview using observation right so that is the reason why we use okay different Tools in doing assessment we do not only rely on tests alone okay because tests and under measurement techniques have strengths and weaknesses they have limitations and to take into account these limitations not to control for these weaknesses when we conduct accessible okay another assumption is that various sources of air are part of the assessment process a relationship is a previous one when you do assessment no there are different sources of there are uh strengths and weaknesses one of these weaknesses error will always be there limitations when you do assessment now error will always be there and when we say error okay it refers to a long-standing assumption that factors other than what a test attempts to measure will influence the performance of the individual don't suggest nothing yeah say for example we can no longer say in Hindi for example whenever like exam anxiety all right or if if the test taker is not feeling well okay um yeah so and also my other extreme use factors no if not feeling well Basha there's anxiety okay and so on yeah so for example no an intelligence test score could be subject to debate concerning the degree to which the obtained score truly reflects the person's intelligence so say for example means so similar questions can be raised in psychological testing a psychological test is it or is it an accurate reflection say for example if it's a psychological test it will turn out that your um mathematical ability is low so mathematical ability mode or is it simply because of error is it because you don't possess the ability is it because or is it because of error okay error will always be there error is not something that we can remove error will always be a part of assessment but what we do in assessment is to control forever as much as possible we minimize error but instead and got going out and we will do our best to control for error we will do our best to minimize our and to minimize error we make use of tests that are reliable and valid okay no I always say this to my students so error will always be a part of assessment it is not something that foreign but at least we will do our best to control for error for example procedures okay other examples internet okay so error now we should try our best to control this uh for this error or to minimize this error yeah so there are many potential sources of error okay like if you're if your test taker has a flu at the time assessors can also be sources of error say for example what if young test administrator procedure What If instead of two hours but that can be a source of error and also some tests are simply better than others in measuring what they prefer to match or in other words mean son is poorly made perfect which is why test selection is indeed very important okay yeah so that's for assumption number five no error is always there it's not something that we can get rid of but instead it is something that is right now um second to the last assumption okay testing assessment can be conducted in a fair and unbiased manner assumptions related problems okay yeah so one source of fairness related problems is the test user who attempts to use a particular test with people whose background and experience are different from the background and experience of people for whom the test was intended in other words or best example would be motherless in doing assessments from the West American made this in the Philippine setting now if you will do something like that your problem is that um in the first place it's validity in the Philippine setting may be questionable it's such a smaller sources of fairness related problem it's possible because that it will appear that your IQ is low not because you have a low IQ but instead it's because you cannot relate those amount of questions for example what if the test question is who is the first Prime Minister of this country who is the author of this book okay what is the capital of California something like that Okay so related problems issues under um fairness related problems it's possible that the test was not intended for this population yet so to control for that no nothing how can we conduct tests in a fair manner what we can do is to unana we can make use of tests that are in the culture loaded but rather in a culture Fair tests that doesn't rely on your understanding of English which is why you can use it even with non-english speakers or another thing we can do is to instead of borrowing tests from other countries a culture nothing we can create our own tests or we can use the existing tests that were made for Filipinos like a filipino-made personality tests filipino-made intelligence tests okay and so on okay we can use tests that are more culturally sensitive tests that have been validated in the local setting and also other than that to conduct tests test Fair manner we can make use of standardized procedures okay I think you're familiar with standardization that's about the similarity in procedures if you want testing and assessment to be fair then we should ensure standardization testing means 45 minutes but finish or not finish you submit your paper up on 45 minutes okay and last assumption is that testing an assessment benefit Society okay so we are doing all of this we do assessment we do testing because we know that what we are doing is beneficial what we are doing is helpful in a world without past okay here are some examples in a world without tests someone can get hired not because they possess the ability but because and we don't want that to happen assessment in the HR setting we want people to be hired based on their ability not based on their physical appearance not base and so on okay teachers and school administrators May label somebody as having a sound May label a child as a special child or a child with ADHD basis that will happen in a world without this without testing an assessment depressed my personality disorder in a world without tests there will be no instruments to diagnose neuropsychological impairments and even psychological problems in a world without tests in a world without board exams in the world without quizzes how can we make meaningful decisions how do we know synonym how do we know who deserves to be enrolled to be admitted admitted in a certain University and so on right so these are the seven assumptions in psychological testing and assessment right if you have questions and concerns now you may type it in the comments no so I can answer them yeah I hope this is a fruitful session I hope you learned something you know and let me know if you want me to do more live streams so that in the future I can cover more topics knowing the different uh areas of psychology uh maybe not through pre-recorded video but instead through live streaming okay um so I think that's it no I hope I was able to share a lot to you this afternoon thank you very much for for watching this live stream now I'll see you next time thank you and goodbye everyone
