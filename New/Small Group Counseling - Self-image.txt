don't have any specific play or you know probably somewh that you would like to I'll probably get a job so that's about it okay all righty okay so we run out of questions but the most important question here is what is my self image um when you look in the mirror and um you see an image of yourself the mirror can only show what's on the outside though so like you know the shape of your nose your eyes your lips your features um but you know actually you know you cannot tell you you're not able to to see um the sense of humor um the secrets that you're afraid to share or your thoughts your feelings so to figure out what's your self-image you actually need to be honest about how you think and feel about yourself so so let's just um think about how you treat yourself how well you understand um why you choose to do the things you do the way that you handle the feelings that you experience each day um actually accepting how you feel about yourself can be a little challenging don't you think yeah um but some days you might feel pretty happy and others say you probably don't think that will think the opposite so when what is really important is that in those days that you can make um something good out of that out of that day that you know good things could happen so let's just um Let's do an activity and you guys are this is I don't know who wants to start but um I'm going to put it right here in the middle and you guys are going to answer three questions the three questions are how would you describe the person you see in the mirror you guys are going to look at
