your personalized Rohit Sharma sign certificate now before making you stop anymore let me start pry welcome the first question of the day is to you um when we talk about overall Wellness prey I mean it's such a vast topic uh what in your mind and what do you think that overall Wellness actually means today hi so overall Wellness in a simplest words it's mean being fit but when we Define Being Fit we need to consider the age as it is obvious that we cannot compare 20 years old with 40 years old and then 40 years old with 80 years old so we need to consider the age Factor when we Define overall wellness and aging is inevitable I tell my client that you don't have any other choice but to age gracefully so I'll give you a little bit more detail that say for example the today's code when we see that by age 0 by age 40 people start gaining weight they start getting digestive issues like acid idity will hit constipation will hit bloating will hit by 50 people will start getting into all kind of ailments diabetes high cholesterol high blood pressure thyroid by age 60 all your muscles and your bones they will start reminding you that they are there and by age 70 and 80 it is more about mental ailment or mental Wellness so when you define Wellness or overall Wellness it is also imperative to know at which phase of Life how well you are managing that particular phase that's quite interesting to know um I'm dreading and I'm sure everybody is dreading aging uh because as you grow older you get all these ailments you know you actually realize what the reality of life is and you've spent most of your productive years you know working taking care of family uh your kids and whoever matters to you that you forget the person you are and you forgotten to take care of yourself uh so very well said pry um all of us are working professionals we are always busy there's something else which is always our priority uh how do we then plan for you know overall Wellness for our family for ourselves for our kids how how does that work I mean do we have enough time uh so this question has also hidden message that busy people they don't have enough time this is the question which I get from my clients often that just because we are busy we don't have time and I let me tell you that it's a myth uh busy is good to be honest busy is good and whenever we say know that an idle mind is a devil's workshop I believe that thoroughly that just because you're busy you cannot say that you cannot take care of that small small things so I always whatever I tell them I'm going to tell that to you you need to shift your mindset you need to shift the perspective and you need to tell yourself that what exactly is needed to become well so have you heard of Blue Zone solutions by any chance yeah Krishna sir has said so basically it is about a research of healthiest living people in the world and disease free and when the research was happened on their life that which kind of secret formula which they are having which we don't have that was shedding more light on overall Wellness that what is basically expected from from us to become well and you'll be surprised after so much of research after so much of efforts when they interviewed people and ultimately what was the outcome they were eating well no Nutri like nutritious nutritious food was given the most priority No Junk Food whatsoever of course smoking alcohol were not there alcohol is a debatable question so I'm not saying more about it they were not having fancy GS to work they were were just moving their body they were just doing household shows you can say gardening farming but they were moving their body plus the most important thing they had amazing social connections and they also followed a purpose of life so now I tell my clients that being busy does that stop you from following your purpose in life from managing little bit of nutrition after of your haptic life or managing your body more busy is not nothing but maybe a myth or a belief or maybe a genuine concern that how do you manage this particular part but when you shift your mindset then Things become really easy so it is nothing but shifting your mindset uh and that is what will lead you to path to Wellness amazing pretty shifting your mind you know mindset to become more aware uh and leading to the path of Wellness uh welcome Krishna I think you have already achieved this you know uh mindset and uh indoubly you are the you know undoubtly you are the most fit man probably on the floors of Max life uh and you also you know have such a tyght schedule such a pack schedule uh just wanted to know from you you know how do you manage everything how have you managed to achieve this Krish you're on mute you'll have to unmute yourself thank you I hope my wife is tuned into the webinar I'll get some better ratings from her at home and um you know it has not come easy and the point that I'm picking from uh pretia is everybody has 24 hours so you got to plan your time work will be always there and I was not blessed with the same level of Fitness as I was 10 years before and I've had my own share of aches and pains etc etc what I learned if I were to just put it is uh it is your body it's your place of worship I would put it like that so you living on what you created for yourself last 10 years in the last 10 years so imagine what you're going to have in the next 10 years everyone in India will live long we are all going to be leading longer lives thanks to Advanced Medical treatment how you live is our choice um and that's the quality of life uh before I say anything do things that are sustainable that are relevant for you and don't get into a race don't get into an ego race with somebody um what works for me is uh I'm a early uh Riser so it helps and um you know I get my time for a good 15 20 minute meditation I do my stretches then I'll hit the gym and I'll spend depending on uh what my day is plan um and here also it's also planned it's not something I'll just walk along and I'll find out what I want to do um when we have a plan we'll end up doing it that's the point I'm saying so I'll do three days of weightlifting two days of cardio one or two days of yoga and I love that do what you can love do what you love and do what you can sustainably uh you know continue and instead of waiting for one eventual day like a new year that I will become fit as a resolution to start something um and starting off something small is also most welcome and um I would say say uh genetics only takes you that far you to work on uh many other things for your um I would say uh for your longevity and how you live long and that energy that you create in yourself because of exercises or being fit and doing that movement and the nutrition Etc is going to last for your uh you know that day that's the way I have seen it's a virtual cycle now I would also say 10 minutes in the gym is better than doing five more minutes in the snooze department on the bed because the endorphins kick in the moment you start your warmup and your exercises you feel good and that being good I have always said and my wife also reposes this that I am in a position of importance and Authority not only in my office but in my entire society and in my community so if I am grumpy if I am dull it's not going to help any of us so we have a duty to be positive to be optimistic to be recharged and create that infectious Circle amongst all of us that's the way I will sort of put it um uh a lot of people think uh today I will go and do a crash diet we have a specialist here in pry um I will you know during the course of the conversation also um request her to talk about the pitfalls of that because I've seen people fluctuate over to you sub thank you so much Krishna for those valuable nuggets I think all of us should start uh today uh if not right now uh and we should you know make a plan for ourselves however small that is and try to you know stick to it so that we achieve our dreams and like you said that you know we need to be happy rather than snoozy so so that's the you know takeway from here uh welcome uh you are going to help us become financially well uh so I was reading somewhere that you know the medical inflation is at about 14% which is literally double of the inflation that the country is seeing um because you interact with customers and consumers so much uh do you think that you know as Indians we are well prepared to tackle this so thank you thank you subna uh and good afternoon everyone I think subna the question which you posed I think the answer to it like many other things in life is not a clear yes or a no there are both sides to it as I see uh I think definitely over the last three four years especially after the pandemic hit I think the awareness among the general population about the reality of facing a big medical event and having to go through uh expenses is much much more real in a lot of people's mind so the awareness and hence the adoption or the attitude towards uh medical insurance has definitely increased and we see it we see it in terms of the data which is uh published regularly so health insurance as an industry is growing uh at a rate of 25 to 30% for the last 2 three years uh there's also a report out where uh it is visible that the summer shorts the B covers which people used to buy uh there always a problem with insurance that insurance they underestimate the requirements so that also has seen a lot of upliftment so where earlier the covers used to be around two to three lakhs we Ely see the average cover people buy now is around at least in the urban centers around 5 to six and even 10 lakh is not a unheard of covers which people Aspire for so I think that part definitely shows that we have made progress as a nation as a society towards preparedness uh for handling uh medical expenses and the inflating expenses but the reality still is that this is still not enough and that's the uh flip side of the question which which I mentioned that there is a no also to it and that is visible also in the stats which emerg that even after trying to keep Pace uh with the reality of uh getting hospitalized having medical expenses uh there is still uh as per different estimates around UH 60 to 70% depending on the report you read uh is the out of pocket expense as the report calls it so even after the government's aayushman bhat scheme has been launched and is used quite well uh the attitudes of personal in Insurance private insurance have increased still of the total health expenditure that happens in the country around 60 to 70% is still born by the outof pocket expense which the customer themselves are paying for it so this is actually a sobering reality while this number used to be upwards of 80% it has fallen but still 60 to 70% is a significant significant expenditure which uh people still end up uh making out of their own pockets and I think that is uh definitely to do with inflation because uh as we are finding out Krishna also mentioned the treatments are improving right uh prti also referred to that as people are uh experiencing these benefit of treatment the costs are something which we are finding difficulty in keeping Pace with right uh as a society I think we are definitely not prepared because estimates suggest that every year around two to three CR people in India it's not a small number two to three CR people actually end up facing the brink of poverty because of medical instances so it is either insurances run out or they have to borrow money to continue with their treatment and that actually leads to IND families actually breaking apart in terms of how they continue so preparedness I think we are still as a society not really prepared even though we are making progress thank you so much for that uh I think you know there must be some things that we can do uh to you know make sure that the society progresses also so hold on to that thought I'll come back to you uh you know with a follow-up question uh before I I do that uh pry my next question and I think Krishna queued me beautifully for that uh is that you know we are always uh in this uh quick fixes syndrome these days you know we want a hid exercise or we want a keto diet or you know or something you know that's quickly going to help me uh become fitter healthier uh you know better Etc so what is your advice uh prti in that in that spare you know how do you think that you know we should you know actually you know uh look forward to making our health rather than do you think that quick fixes work or they do not work or what should we do so I tell them jard and I'm not an advocate of quick fixes as we have mentioned in Blue Zone solution is also it's like you have to do your lifestyle changes for your life that's why it is called lifestyle changes and as rightly mentioned by Krishna that it is a it is more that how you take your life from first end to the second end it's not about the quick fixes and it will help you in your short term but now in your question only you have mentioned that there are so many things in the market yeah there's so many things in the market but rightly said by udba that numbers are increasing so if those products are able to help us then why the numbers are increasing so it's definitely a mismatch and we are missing very important Point here we are more just because we are busy we are just grabbing for the short-term Solutions and we may miss the main link that what is exactly important so I give one Mantra to my clients that that they have to take care of the three parameters and they have to take take Mark in all the boxes they cannot miss even one box if you really want to manage your life well so first is physical of course we know that physical health is important so imagine that you have earned super money you have worked so much hard you have good bank balance and your mental health is also nice so your brain is charged up your brain wants to work more you have more money but you are not getting support from your health it's ultimately it's not going to make work in fact you will be in a worse situation imagine a situation where body is not helping you your mind is powerful So Physical box needs to be ticked for sure second comes emotional and mental well-being of course now imagine the situation you your body is absolutely well you can do whatever you want to do you are also financially stable but your mental health is not that great now we know that numbers of Alzheimer dementia anxiety depression everything is rising it's not that I'm saying the numbers are saying that that we are somewhere missing the Improvement of our mental health so I tell my clients that simultaneously when you uh focus on reducing your weight improving your digestive health improving hormonal imbalance you also need to improve your brain health and it is possible when you work on improving your brain health you will definitely get result and there is not a good situation to have a financially stable life but not remembering name of our grandchildren so by 70s and 80s if you want to really Live Well if you really want to enjoy that last leg of life you need to have a stable healthy mind that is a second take you need to put that tick mark in the second box and the third is Financial Security now I bet everybody who's listening to me must be knowing one person who had to cut short their treatment because of financial crunches it's maybe we or our other family member or relative or even domestic health so I tell them that Financial Health is so much important that even if you're physically well if you are mentally well but if you're not able to take that treatment you will you will really feel sorry about it and it is also not only about your financial security this is a maybe a social responsibility for us that we are managing our life but what about our domestic Health everyone around us needs to be aware that they need to be financially secured because as mentioned by that medicine expenses are rising Rising how you know and in that accidents happen so if you really want to protect yourself please take this uh Financial stability so three parameters physical mental emotional and financial all that boxes you need to tick mark If you really want to work well so no jard only lifestyle changes and make sure you cross all these boxes yeah thank you so much pry Krishna I hope that answers your question um pry will come back to you for more on you know physical and mental uh on the financial well-being part um how do you see Max Life playing a role in it what is it that Max life is doing for his customers prospects or every Indian uh you know who can benefit from what Max life has to offer yeah uh so subna I think uh I I'll continue where I left off when I previously was addressing your point around are we prepared and uh the fact that we when we get into a serious medical issue and we realize that uh we actually are staring at as a family as an average Indian we can stare actually at poverty uh because of uh running out of either insurance or running even out of our savings I think have to realize uh that medical insurance is important but that is not the end of it if I were to say that I have planned for that part of my life Financial Security because medical insurance if we really think about the basics of medical insurance it is making good the cost we incur in the hospital or maybe the surrounding medication and the consultations which we need to get through but the fact is that when that extreme event happens uh the real severe diseases while an average hospitalization ranges around depending on the city UH 60 to 70,000 in a tier three City and maybe one and a half lakhs around in a Metro and a uh top top eight cities uh the real significant events which they happen typically would cross the amount average summer shs which we buy in terms of a medical insurance so if an event strikes which is actually draining on our finances our medical insurance will not be enough so there is something we need to think Beyond medical insurance definitely you mentioned medical inflation is 14 to 15% right so fooling ourselves into believing that there is a savings I have put it aside I've done an FD if my insurance runs out I will use that uh let's say pool of money we have to be honest that will never keep Pace with the inflation right there we that money will earn us 5% 6% inflation is as you mentioned at the start of our discussion is running at 2x so our savings are not going to be enough even at that situation so definitely the answer to that lies in Insurance because insurance will keep us prepared uh for that extreme events and not requiring us to set aside money out of our savings and that's where uh as Max life insurance and as insurance industry in life insurance in general we believe there is a role for products Beyond medical insurance which actually can serve at a very very affordable rates to top up the requirements which emerge out of these situations so uh definitely uh the critical illnesses which we uh encounter and which are most commonly understood diseases of the heart kidney liver cancer included uh these really really high severity events as we would like to uh call them uh we have uh plans in place which uh add on to the normal life insurance which people buy and at a very affordable rate these provide a fixed amount you can choose a some assured and these will be paid irrespective of what you have incurred as a cost as a part of your hospitalization so if you have taken a cover for a critical illness with a life insurer uh and you happen to be diagnosed with that disease uh no matter whether it's a two-day hospitalization 5day hospitalization whatever you have incurred as part of your medical insurance uh you can you will definitely by claiming against these policy from your life insurer get a lumps some amount to take care of your expenses now here also we need to realize uh medical emergency is not just a cost of hospitalization there is a big reality that when you undergo a very very severe disease like a brain stroke or a cancer which actually has wrecked havoc on your body medical advancements perhaps have allowed you to stay alive but there is a long recovery period involved in a lot of these diseases and 70 70 75% of India is still self-employed not salaried and even salaried people sick leaves can run out so an outcome of having a medical emergency is not just Medical hospital bills they are actually loss of income also so your business might suffer for that period your uh you might have work uh leaves without pay during that period so and you will have Emi still to pay right your B family bills household bills do not stop so covering for those require something Beyond medical insurance and this is where such kind of products can help so we have two kind of two products available with Max life one I mentioned critical illness related add-ons we call them Riders and we also have a product which people can actually use uh as part of the savings so can set aside a part of money every month or every year uh that buys you insurance and hopefully if your uh Health doesn't suffer you do not incur any uh event the money actually is returned to you at the end of the uh policy so actually it is best of both world because you can you have an option of buying unlimited one CR two CR of ins medical insurance also but that will cost you money and if you're not utilizing it it can be a train on your purse but there are products available which return your money uh but also pay you in case of a medical event so those are the ways you can uh complement your existing medical insurance and be better financially prepared that is great to know uh that we have you know offerings from Max life uh which stretch beyond the medical uh you know insurances that we have and that can actually help us secure our family ourselves and our family much much better U thank you so much for telling us that uh Krishna my next question is to you uh OV told us you know what are the products that are available but in our general life uh what tips and tricks do you give to your customers for them to be financially prepared I'm not so sure about the tips and the tricks because there aren't any but there's a method that can work um I would say uh and I don't want to appear prachy um having been in financial service for what 25 years I can say the following first of all uh did mind what are your goals I I would perhaps put it in five steps First Step what are your goals which means uh suddenly people say I want a crow it won't happen overnight or I'll keep it for 20 years that's also too far off so distinguish really well between what are your shortterm which is one and three years and what are your five to 10 year goals I think this is what one can see so first is the goal part the second part is just a goal is not good enough you need to have a plan in place which means um how do I reach there um and to reach there you need uh droplets of savings right they say small Drops make a big ocean right so what are the savings elements that you're going to be having and let's spend some time there um option one most people live in income let's spend equal to savings simplistically option two which I would Advocate everybody does is income less savings equal to the spends so prioritize savings uh as opposed to savings becoming an eventuality because I have spent a lot on savings there are multiple levels of um instruments that are now vibrant in India uh you must know what is meant for what purpose um and we'll spend perhaps some part of it during the course of this webinar third I would say uh keep an emergency fund um it can happen we recently collected a fundraiser for a colleague of ours who met with a drastic accident that apart anything for you or for your near and dear ones you need to have an emergency Corpus 3 months to 6 months of salary that you should keep that you can dig in deeper uh and that's where life insurance actually falls in place life insurance is traditionally the bed rock of all financial instruments like we see a building a building can only be as tall as its basement is and really um how well we construct our basement is dependent on the quality of life insurance cover and the value of life insurance that you have you must know what's your human life value in India uh it's very linear As you move up in your age your income increases hopefully uh and your responsibilities also increase uh one gets to finish up at least College there isn't a loan broadly most parents still don't put kids on loan at least in India then your marriage then your kid then you want to buy a vehicle then you want to buy a car then you marry off you know education Etc so that should be really the cover that you need and insurance is I would say the equivalent of assurance of income in case one is not able to earn uh I would say the fourth point is really uh keep a close tab on your expenses per se it's good to celebrate wins and you must because it motivates you to win more as well as earn more but keep a tab on those big ones big spend that one should have lastly I would say um really understand what um are tax saving instruments uh India has a saving is a savings economy U my sensus what 26% of income is saved in general I mean this is the average um why does the government encourage such savings it's because people find it very difficult to understand reach big goals they say okay you save in small instruments um there is a variety out here as I was saying earlier you have small scale um you know government sponsored ones employers provide Provident fund uh you can create a compus through I would say even um you know life insurance uh you have fds before going to mutual funds and Equity related instruments which only very few people understand you must have this in full Suite So In Sum a five five step plan first is what are your goals distinguish between short and long term number two have a clear plan in place third save well four create an emergency fund five um see to it that you also utilize tax saving instruments in your uh savings mix that's what I would suggest that will hold good for as an evergreen concern thank you so much Krishna I think all of us can benefit from this five PR approach uh where we plan and we save and we have an emergency Corpus and obviously we take care of what our tax saving instruments have to offer so I think that's a very Fresh Approach uh to look at how Financial Prudence can be built in in our you know daily lives uh coming back to you pry uh earlier you spoke about you know physical and mental well-being U now when I think of mental well-being I don't think that in India we still normalized going to a therapist uh going to a psychiatrist psychologist you know actually knowing what's going on in our mind I I don't think that we've reached that kind of openness um a lot of us don't even know what mental wellbe means uh so if you can you know help us understand what does it actually mean and U everybody keep everybody talks about stress so the golden question to you is that you know can be we ever be stressfree so uh yeah of course mental well-being is important but nowadays I have also noticed shift in my mindset now people have started going to therapist people have started accepting that mental health is very important uh so when I talk about my clients I show them an overall big picture so instead of uh so clients also come and ask me that I know I'm stressed I know that it is killing me but what to do with it majority problem when I have noticed is clients are aware of it they just don't know how to manage with it it's like think about an elephant or don't think about an elephant and immediately you will see elephant in front of you so if you really if you try that no no I will not think about an elephant by that logic you will never be able to remove that stressor for sure so I teach them crowding out concept that instead of focusing so first first step is you need to identify your stress points so as Krishna has said about all Financial stresses that is taken care of so I think I'll focus more on health health wise that what kind of questions that people get worried for now uh small small questions they come and ask me that I don't think I'm taking good care of my life I don't have time and in that what do I do so I tell them that start noting Down Start identify your stress that is the first thing it's like deciding your goal that what exactly you want out of your life simple question like I'm not drinking enough water okay so then there are water apps are you trying are you using that second is I'm eating too much out and I don't think I'm eating nutritious food so I tell them okay then maintain food diary maintain your log and then understand whether you are really eating out quite often you really need to make a shift into that or you are just stressing out because perceived stress is much worse than the actual stress and stress is killer that is going to invite all kinds of ailments so you need to focus your stress absolutely well before stress hit you now one more thing I tell them that which my dad used to tell me that uh someone can make a kit for you or you can say a fuit food platter it will be served to you but ultimately you will have to chew you will have to consume that no one else can consume it for you and can give you benefit so here I also tell them that whatever stress you are facing through in life first of all identify and take a first step action will lead to you some solution just talking about it just stressing out about it it is not going to help you in any ways so I follow the advice of my dad that my KY okay if anyone else is making at least I'm chewing it by myself so first thing is to take action so that is the Mantra which I give to my client that whether you feel that it's a m mental health or it's a physical health or it's any other thing which is stressing you out first of all identify your stress and take help from all the apps now I also have seen maxfit is a brilliant app in that if you feel you are not moving enough so there's a Tracker then it also helps you maintaining your medicine history it also has various parameters which can identify whether you actually have a problem or you are just stressing out yeah all those things really help and will help you ultimately remove your stress for sure so take first action max can just provide you app Max cannot download it for you Max cannot uh make you use it it's you you have to take use of all those things so my advice sincere advice to all of you that everything is important stress is important stress is Skiller so take first step and take some action before stress hits you st taking action and that will lead to Solutions there's nothing other there's no other magic formula and the simple things work thank you so um I think I take away the K point the most that so you know uh I think uh you know that's a beautiful uh point to be put uh before we move forward I would just remind my audience to keep asking your questions we are already getting lots of questions uh so please ask your questions and also please rate US that just really helps us bring better content to you helps us you know become better as an organization um now pry you briefly spoke about the maxfit app so here's where I'll come back to you uh can you throw more light on this app how can somebody get it what are the benefits uh and you know what does it actually do for you yeah uh thanks subna so uh maxfit app by Max life is uh a part of a journey of realizing what all health and wellness is about right so offering the Riders and the product which we call SAA uh was part of a journey to realize that for actually meeting customers Health uh needs we need something in addition to medical insurance and realizing that Wellness actually and Health and Living a healthy life is actually a holistic concept than just uh perhaps uh eating or having access to financial needs we realize that Max life also needs to partner its customers in this entire Journey so for that what we have launched as part of maxfit app is the approach we have taken is about a personalized care rather than becoming another of a fitness app which offers best discounts on Fitness we or health supplements Etc so this app right now is available with two of our products so if you buy the max life SAA which is secured earnings and wellness Advantage plan that's the product I talked about which gives benefits uh and also returns your premium uh so you give you get benefits some assured as part of your uh insurance plan but also the money which you put in for as premium also gets returned to you so it is saving as well as planning for health emergencies so and the critical illness related Rider the add-on product which I discussed so this app is available with these two products uh when you buy these products you have an option to download the app and using your mobile number Etc which you use to purchase the product you can straight away login into the app now as I mentioned the app is created around the concept of uh personalized healthare because uh you as a human your needs will be very very different to another person so the first point of First Landing activity on the app is at is a good 30 40 minute conversation with a professional health practitioner uh so you have a conversation you discuss how how your uh workstyle is how your lifestyle is what are the current situations you are having what are you eating all aspects related to health so we call that a health risk assessment so that is actually the starting point of the wellness Journey on this app using this on the app our Healthcare Providers create a sort of profile for you in terms of what are your most immediate action areas and uh the second feature which I find most useful on the app which we have created is a 24x7 healthc care support so it's a chat support uh which you have access to 247 so you can just type in your current need it might be that I am having migraine pain or those basic daily things which keep on happening but the beauty is that because you have gone through the health risk assessment the response will be contextualized to what your overall situation is rather than just a response he next Dom Leo right something so you won't just get very very uh generic answers the answers will be specific to you so I find that actually an approach to holistic Wellness because you need to understand your whole reality before taking actions uh We've realized we touched upon the mental Wellness part uh during our discussion so there is also a module of relevant blogs and very very nice podcasts about a meditation uh deep breathing all these Concepts which help out in terms of relaxation when you are stressed uh there are of course uh annual Health checkups available which you can do discounted medicine bookings Tel consultations with general physicians Specialists all these are health related ecosystem is available on the app uh right now it is available with two of our products which are our offerings to our customers for health and wellness planning so that's that's about it thank you so much I think uh it's a great app and I think everybody who's listening to us today uh must download this and get the benefits of what the app has to offer uh pry uh my next question to you you talked about Kit the most important thing so how does nutrition or what role does nutrition actually play uh in the overall well-being of a human being so in textbook definition you can say that it is an essential material which body requires to function optimally it is a material for the body so it really defines what kind of material you providing to your body and the body will function accordingly so it is like training an employee motivating them giving all kind of data giving nice cab nice environment and what if you don't provide him or her particular software or an internet connection it will definitely have some impact on the productivity similarly body requires certain kind of vitamins and minerals protein fat water and that particular proportions whenever I deal with my clients I have always seen that they make a mistake in understanding proportion because there are so many diets in the market but the teaching that exactly what are the proportions required for the body not for your palette but for your body what is required so I teach then a plate method it is very quick and very easy to understand no need to calculate any calories whatever you are eating your plate should be divided uh half into fruits and vegetables fruit should be little less than 1/4 and vegetable should be little more than 1/4 so your half plate should be with fruits and vegetables only one fourth plate should be with Protein healthy protein protein is a building block for for our body we require it for repair and rejuvenate so if you don't eat protein body will not have that material to repair so you're not providing material to body so body will not be able to help even if body wishes to body is very kind to us and the 1/4th plate remaining should be with the whole grain and in the whole grain you need all the varieties so think about all that Nach ragi jaar Baja Kimba oat wheat rice usually what we do we end up eating uh products with the made with the wheat and rice so you know that sweet stuff and all so our C consumption or that whole green consumption is much more than 1/4 it is minimum I can say more than half so ultimately we are providing body so much material which is useless so that's why body is saving that that can lead you weight gain now if you follow this plate you will never have to calculate calories you will never have to worry about supplements that which kind of supplements I'm consuming because you are getting enough supplements or from the fruits and vitamins and second it is natural sauce so body will be able to absorb it in a better manner plus it is full of fiber your digestive system is absolutely clear when you are following this kind of practices so I tell my clients always consider this that you are giving some work to a person expecting them to work optimally and not providing them with enough material what they require to fulfill that work it is not going to solve the purpose nutrition is simple like that understand portions understand half fruits vegetables half is 1/4 is protein and 1/4 is whole grain little bit of fat and water that's the formula thank you so much pry for teaching us a balanced diet and how we should look at our plate uh we're getting lots of questions so Krishna my last question will be to you before we open up for the audience um when we think of life insurance we think of a really long complicated process uh so can you help us understand what Max life is doing to probably simplify it for their customers yeah um that's a great question um we have a lot to do in the industry in terms of simplifying the concept of life insurance and you know

understand how one can very easily reach out to Max life insurance and fulfill all their requirements I think this is superb to know that the brand is available physically and digitally to help customers uh take care of all of their needs uh now we have lots of audience questions uh pry the first one is to you from Niha how can I build physical and mental Wellness import in my child yeah so it's a very important question and I have so I have a daughter who's 19 years old and I have seen that kids they learn by looking at us or observing us and uh I'll give you so this formula works with everything if you want to make them work or if you want to make them read you read if you want to make them eat healthy food you eat healthy food or provide that environment which can encourage them to grab that thing without forcing because kids they learn with the observation I'll give you quick example in Co we suddenly had to cancel vacation and my daughter came and asked me mama what will I do in that vacation I'm like what do you want to do I want to do online class I'm like online course see she said mama you always do online courses no so I also want to do online course so I never thought that she's observing me that I'm studying I'm reading this is how you pass on uh the values to children whether it is food or ethics or values in life whether it is mental health you be there for your children and be a role model that's it this is the shortest message to Niha this will applicable in all the situation in your life thank you so much prey for that wonderful answer uh udab I think you can take the next one it's from radika she's asking I an entrepreneur what are some of the max life offerings that I can use to build an emergency fund for myself right Krish maybe you can also add to this one so radika life insurance uh products the the core of the product is of course to prepare you for the emergencies in life which might be today we have discussed a lot about the health emergencies but there is of course the biggest emergency in terms of being prepared preparing for your family and your dependents in case of the unfortunate event of you passing away so like life insurance the core concept of life insurance is of course preparing for that but life insurance products also allow you as Krishna mentioned uh disciplined savings every month a part of your money goes into a uh savings mechanisms life insurance is a great tool to practice that because life insurance allows you to spread your savings and plan for a milestone by monthly or annual amounts rather than you having to choose something right as a lump some so there are lots of products available you can uh utilize them they give you an option both to plan for a milestone typically for your child education so you put in premiums for 5 years or 10 years you contribute over a period where you can uh save money and then plan for a milestone which might be let's say 18 years out to when your child is born you plan for a some amount as Krishna mentioned you plan for an outcome and then basically calculate through discipline routs you through life insurance you can also uh get exposure to uh savings and get exposure to uh equities which today a lot of us are finding uh very very attractive so mutual funds like you do in mutual funds sip you can do through life insurance also and also benefit from the tax advantage that life insurance offers which Krishna mentioned you need to be aware of your uh choices when you make a financial uh savings Choice what are the tax outcomes so there are unit link products which we call them with are Market related uh you can also utilize life insurance products for that so there are lots of lots of options available uh I would urge you to go onto Max live website and explore investment plans uh as long as well as insurance plans or there are advisers Max life advisor thousands of advisers available or the bank branches of Access Bank yes bank which are our biggest bank bank Assurance Partners you can reach out to any of these uh uh options and learn more about the choices thank you so much for putting it so beautifully uh given the interest of time I'll take the last two questions and pry both of them are to you uh the first one is from Ruka she's asking uh gyms and other subscriptions are very expensive nowadays how can I ensure physical and mental wellbeing on a budget on a budget so as uh I discussed about the Blue Zone solutions to be honest we wrote that is a shift in perspective which everybody has to apply that it is not about the budget now say for example if you want to consume protein if you don't have money to consume healthy nuts or seeds you can consume sing Chan right so it's not that only when you have budget you can take care of your mental and nutrition wealth our India is Rich with all kinds of nutrition we have and to be fit say for example if you want to talk about your health so in that what did they ask you to consume fruits vegetables whole grain and protein options nothing else and that is I think affordable to all when you try to make it fancier when you try to think that oh this fancy diet will make my life super that it is not going to help second when I teach my clients and especially kids I always tell them that playing games with them you must have seen that small small Clips on Instagram that you know with that glass and cup and all those kind of people just do activity with kids just to play with them just to make them busy so does that require lots of Finance we just have to have a shift in our mindset that just because you have good money then only you can take care of your nutrition and mental well-being just spending one hour in one week with the family is must that is the rule in our house those things those laughter will definitely help you you settled on your mental health much more than going to therapist believe me so change your mind perspective and try I just tell my clients just try and then tell me whether it is working not working make your life simple eat normal nutrition clean nutrition avoid junk as much as possible add healthy lifestyle sit with your kids sit with your family member laugh and then see magic happens thank you so much pry that's so beautifully put that you know sit with your family have a laughter do and uh that will really help us alleviate a lot of the stress that we get uh pry my last question to you is from R and I think this is something that everybody will resonate with quite a bit how can one maintain emotional Wellness when most of the families are getting nuclear kids are moving out how do I maintain my emotional well-being in that case so that is again applicable to me my daughter just blew out yeah last year and I felt that emptiness syndrome no again a shift in mindset I started doing everything what I really wanted to do started painting started music Started mingling With Friends of course we know that we love our parents we love our kids but ultimately it is it should be the love with ourself like people say know that if you are born in your company that means that think about it in which company you are with so you cannot say that I don't know what do I do with my life there are lots of things and on the other hand we also complain that I don't have time so just try to ask that what exactly you are looking out of your life sometimes you know client ask questions but they are not the real questions the root cause is somewhere else so I tell them that work on a root cause if you trying to say that my kids they are going out but have you also thought about it that you were also cribbing that every day morning at 7:00 to wake up and make a tiffen I don't have time for myself I don't have time to go for exercise now you have time we all love our kids right who doesn't but still this is a fact of life that they are going to go out even Partners if you just hold the hold your partners withit too much what will happen you will start getting problem with each other right you need to give space to each other this rule applies with each and everybody whether it is partner whether it is children whether it is parents so try and enjoy your own company try to find out your purpose in life I guess the source ultimate reason that we are working we are leaving we are eating is all because we want to be happy so find out what is your source of Happiness what makes you happy that's it thank you so much pry uh thank youb thank you Krishna we've come to the end of this wonderful session I wish we could have talked more because there's so many questions that are still coming in uh which need to be answered um I have taken up wonderful things out of this webinar today how to prioritize oneself you know talk about your own mental health um and you know be wonderfully wise with yourself so that you know you have the time to take care of yourself your and nurture your mind and body uh I'm sure our audience has benefited immensely today with what we have learned and I'm again thanking Max life insurance for bringing to us this new concept of
